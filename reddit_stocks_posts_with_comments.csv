Collectively, the gold mining stocks make up a commodity basket and should be regarded as a single investment.

Everything I learned about investing has been on my own, not much of a support system in my family. I’m 36 years old, the best thing I’ve done so far was during 2020 I bought all Airliner stocks/Nvidia shares at discount. 

Couple years ago, I sold half of my shares of nvidia to help pay off debt. It’s been real tough out here, with inflation/COL and all that noise. 

Holdings: 250 shares of NVDA left. 
                 27 shares of INTC.

I’ve got a great retirement from work, pension/401k balance is with both $375k at my age and growing. 

I’m looking for advice on where to expand, I’m going to be contributing about $1,600 per month to buying ETF’s. I have $8,000 right now to invest. Goal is to use my earnings to help purchase my first home, garner more knowledge on stocks etc.

I was looking at, expanding my NVDA, INTC holdings. I’m optimistic on INTC. 

Some others I’ve see a lot on here about is ACHR, LUNR, RKLB, QUBT and DDOG. || Curious what thoughts are on this mix of tech-heavy etfs

Some other minor misc. || So.. I've this messy situation. Like, 80% my portfolio is in a retirement account - a basket of ETFs, effectively it's a conservative balanced fund mimicking 40:60 (40% equities, 60% fixed income) allocation. Other 20% is ""play money"" - which, despite what it suggests, I'm **very careful** with. This is roughly equally allotted to:

* ishares semiconductor ETF - gets me a lot of NVDA and other cool $hit
* ishares EU property yield fund
* Rithm Capital - pays me decent 6% post-tax dividend
* Target 
* Schlumberger 
* MSFT 
* Pfizer 
* Taiwan semi
* JPM
* Oracle 

I'm 45F,  single mom, single income, still saving a good portion of it monthly. On Sunday evening, I'm wondering, am I too risk averse? Not planning on going YoLo on RKLB or anything.. but, 

* Q1. should I perhaps step up the gas, and go to 50:50 - from 40:60? 
* Q2. for the ""play money"" part, would you suggest any addition / deletion? 

PS - forgot to mention, 3% of this 20% (0.6% overall), is used for Options a) to hedge, b) to satisfy my FoMo and casino instincts. I don't write options, only buying them to, someday.... hit a jackpot. || Name 3 I need to get rid off and 3 I should add to improve risk/reward?

Started making a lot more money after starting my career so just now starting to put some real money into the market and want to learn more about investing.

\*planning on holding KSCP til Q3 of this year, they ran a whole corporate restructuring (which gave negative earnings the last year and a half) and relisted themselves after being at risk of delisting from NASDAQ, but I've attended lots of their public shareholder meetings and feel confident about them rising in the year with the number of renewed contracts they received + partnering with Verizon just a week or so ago || I have $36k spread amongst 7 companies- AAPL, META, IONQ, RGTI, NVDA, MSFT and AMZN. I am at 91.6% gain (so roughly $19k invested). 
Would I be better off focusing on one high growth potential company? For example, I’m up 95% on NVDA but only have 5 shares…so should I focus more on position size? Goal is $100k next year at this time (I know it’s ambitious, but why not?) || Personally I like your portfolio, you have clearly done well.  I think there are a lot of people on here that say put it in an index fund and relax and there is nothing wrong with that.  You seem to want to be more active.  My only critique would be that is a lot of stocks to manage.  Personally I would trim it, have some stuff that you don’t have to worry about and then maybe 5 big swings that you can go deep on dad and have a bigger portion dedicated to it. || My portfolio performance:

Also like the portfolio. Lots of high quality + growth. Some ""financial infrastructure"" like Visa, Moodys etc might be a place to look next? Or maybe some medical devices companies - also a lot of wide moat and high quality to look into there.

(curious what you are buying now) || Why PSIX? Good catch early on || > Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 

What's the bull case for mitsubishi? Is it just good value or is your thesis based on some geopolitical shifts in its favor (japan allow weapons exports etc)? || What's your gold thesis and why? Near term, everyone's quite bearish. The bulls discussing inflationary policy etc. always sound a bit too conspiratorial to me. I love your low cost, underpriced picks, though. || I approve of IGIC. It's one of my top 3 insurance picks. What made you choose them? || Is the rationale behind NLCP that you’re bullish on the cannabis industry? Or just like the companies financials? || Stick to NVDA, don’t get greedy with speculative stocks. NVDA is a proven company with strong cash flows and growth. Odds are they are going to continue beating the market for years to come (less momentum as years progress obviously) || Careful regarding QUBT, recent information came out making it a risky play. For quantum computing I would look at RGTI, IONQ or D wave :) || I like the high quality mega cap companies that you have. I would caution against SOXX as semiconductors are cyclical. Wall Street might rotate into it but they may rotate OUT and crush you. Not a bad entry point into SOXX right now though. Recommend just concentrating in NVDA. || I don’t understand people building portfolios like this of 15 plus stocks… just buy the SP500 man. The probability that you’re going to beat the index exponentially decreases as you add more and more stocks beyond 8-10. Buy the SP500 and 2-3 HIGH CONVICTION plays where you feel there’s alpha. The rest is a waste of time and will likely just lead to you underperforming. || I don't think this is bad, but: 1) what is your thesis for an EW turnaround? 2) while I know they're not apples-to-apples, I'd say consider choosing ZTS or IDXX and concentrating in one or the other 3) it's bounced lately, but what's the medium/long-term thesis for PAYC? 4) would rather TMO or RGEN than A but it's not a bad company 5) would actually rather diversified BKNG than ABNB. || Very bad selection overall, sorry, just my opinion. Are all your funds parked in these? Or hopefully, just the ""play money""? 


 Sell - Booking, FTNT, Visa (suggesting to book profit, where PE is 30+ with a good run up) 


 Buy - AMD and an index ETF 😂 || Are there competitors to Square? Is it Stripe? I feel like there are already some big players in the payment handling field, going up against . Are you hoping they get purchased? Seems like a lot of the pie to give to them (maybe I'm wrong, though). Can't go wrong with VOO, and I think Google too. || I mean, quite focused on those two companies with a sprinkle of diversification through VOO. If you can stomach a potential downturn on the 7 figure portfolio... :) Here's a breakdown of your mix: [https://insightfol.io/en/portfolios/report/bc3c1b7e31/](https://insightfol.io/en/portfolios/report/bc3c1b7e31/) || Why Square? || Bro bought an s&p etf and then decided to buy every stock in the s&p individually || Too many ETFs 😭 Stick to 3-4 MAX. VOO + QQQM + AVUV/IWM (small caps) is a good mix || Stick to 100% VOO || retired??? at 40? if you dont mind me asking, what is the net worth of this portfolio? you would need some capital growth for the next few years? right? unless you are at $5m+ then you could do well. || Really solid portfolio actually. Well-diversified. Why the allocation in DIS and Visa? Also, would recommend not investing in AFK and opt for something like INDA (India) now. Africa will definitely have its time, that time just isn’t now. || Im not entirely sure on your risk profile but I would do most in VOO/QQQM. If you’re feeling risky throw in more NVDA/GOOGL. SGOV for the safe money. An allocation in AVUV (small caps) for some diversification away from the mega caps. || M20 University Student || I like these names. Why MA, GS, UNH, and CMG? || Just stick to Mag7 and S&P 500. || IONQ and RGTI are too speculative for me. Look at valuations for Mag7. Most enticing for me are NVDA (huge growth prospects) and GOOGL (value pick). Meta and Amazon are positioned well too. || Actually I just have pretty good patience, to sit and watch them grow. Though most of the time I have some cash on hand to buy a little here and there. But most of the stocks are bought with long term hold in mind, with the possibility for a little rebalancing once in a while. || I have lots of time, so I would not say around 15 i too bad. || That was literally the one thing I said I did not want. || I bought MHVFY, WRLGF, AFMJF, and BTAI today, WDOFF and SAND last week. I shaved down APP to 66% of the original stake to reinvest in those companies. || Both. The company has excellent growth prospects and poor financial accounting that understates its operating profitability by around 13x. || Monetary debasement due to reliance on debt to simulate GDP growth separate from the regular structural drivers, and the international desire to establish mediums of exchange with no counterparty risk. Deflation will create a worldwide crash in asset values of historical proportions as well as a credit crunch that will leave the banking system insolvent, therefore inflationary policies will be pursued instead. This is not a conspiracy - it's the logical conclusion of incentives baked into the cake. Think about why the government, despite claims the U.S. consumer is ""resilient"" and the economy is ""strong"", is deficit spending as if we were in the midst of WWII. Deficit spending is supposed to be countercyclical.

People aren't really thinking about the evolution of monetary institutions in the long-term. They're extrapolating stalled momentum as a thesis. 

Gold's upper price depends on its theoretical function when incorporated into the current monetary order. I've heard estimates ranging from $5000 to $20,000 based on mean reversion to various ratios (gold/Treasury coverage, gold/GDP coverage, etc.).

> I love your low cost, underpriced picks, though.

Thanks. I owe a debt of gratitude to John Hussman's work on long-term portfolio performance for shaping my stock preferences. || Both. However, I'm not interested in direct investment: cannabis companies are already struggling to produce appreciable margins since the product is so commoditized. NLCP is my ""picks and shovels"" approach to the industry, one that can consistently produce FCF regardless of tight or loose economic conditions. 

It has stagnated more than I assumed though. Depending on the state of the industry in 2025, I might drop it for another dividend payer with better growth opportunities. || Concentration builds wealth, diversification protects it. || Huh?

Most tech and emerging markets investors I've seen buy 20-30 stocks due to the volality and some losers some winners.

I'm new, explain why that isn't a good idea. || Never thourght of that. Great advice, thanks! || Thanks, very good inputs and questions! 1) EW has re-rated because of a temporary slow down in growth but it is fundamentally a great and profitable company (last 20 + years with stable and high ROIC) and I count on long term secular growth to pick up again from 2026. The huge dip in EW share price was partly because of an overreaction (fear of obesity medicine willl cure heart desease, but I think the opposite will happen -  more people will be able to actually get treatment when they loose weight). 2) ZTS / IDXX: I have held ZTS for a long time and it is a stable core position. IDXX is a recent addition. It has only traded at these multiples very few times since 2017. It has a solid marked position, so I figured it to be a good time to diversify instead of keep adding to ZTS. Both ZTS and IDXX are fundamentally well run businesses with stable/rising margins and I think they are both still here 20 years from now. 3) PAYC (along with BILL) was my play on ""small-cap"". Instead of trying to find a basket of US-small-cap, why not invest on those who will benefit from small-cap taking off? Both have played out almost perfectly in 2024 but even after huge gains, are still trading at reasonable price compared to expected growth. I have worked with HR-software and know exactly how hard it is to switch and I think the PAYC strategy of providing wall-to-wall for smaller companies, has benefits compared to the other vendors in the space (it is tempting for smaller business who have a hard time finding ressources to manage their integrations, but once they are on board, the lock-in is stronger). 4) Good call! I have my eyes on TMO as well - waiting for a price in the 16-18 EV/EBITDA range and may have a critical look at A to find the money. 5) Waiting to see what ABNB will do with their huge war chest ;-) || Thanks, considering AMD already. FTNT and BKNG are two of my biggest winners and I could take profit since I agree they have become a bit expensive. || I understand my way of investing is peculiar, but I found screening and imaging the futures of companies so interesting. || I live pretty frugally and i own my house and car, no dependents. yeah, I want to try and grow what I have so that I can be less careful with my money in later years. My US portion was in VTI and QQQ until very recently, and I moved them to VDC and SGOV. || Thanks!

I've been holding Visa for 3 years in my margin account, because I wanted a safe place to put USD, and now that it's grown by about 50%, I don't want to pay taxes on the gains right now (but may take them early next year).

Disney was a purchase I made because I was happy with the company's brands, and felt like their situation was going to improve post-covid, but it hasn't, and now I'm still down 17%. I'm not necessarily opposed to moving that money to something more likely to improve, it's just getting over my irrational dissatisfaction of cementing existing losses.

AFK was a tip from a friend that did not pay off, and I'm kinda just holding the bag in hopes that it improves, so that I feel less bad about it.  (I don't take tips from him anymore, though.) Same with NTR, actually. || I was in VTI and QQQM until just recently, and trying to play it a bit safer to ride out the political uncertainty. I plan to get back into those after the next pullback/correction. || MA - I believe it has a durable moat.
GS - Bought it back in October 2023 when valuations were at multi year lows.
UNH - Similar to the reason for GS and a durable moat
CMG - Liked the food and the revenue growth:) || i’ve got most of my money in FXAIX that loosely tracks the S&P500 but i’m using the smaller amounts to trade for smaller amounts that i can use more often || You are not probably doing thorough analyses and DD at more than 10 but just going with flow and got luck reading news articles. 

But Congratulations and hope you luck still runs good. || Don’t let others discourage you. This is a great starting portfolio and 15 stocks is a good amount. My only recommendation is diversification, you’re very tech heavy.

You have many blue chip stocks in your portfolio that doesn’t require daily tracking. You’re also not a day trader, you literally can literally just buy and forget. I mean no one’s gonna sit there and research Procter and Gamble (PG) every week. || [deleted] || How long do you plan on holding MHVFY. Bought in a few weeks ago as well. Do you have a specific price target/fair value? || I'm always a bit wary of japanese companies as they have a history of bad governance (keiretsu, cash hoarding, bad handling of small shareholders etc). Even if it looks cheap sometimes you just don't get the value unlocked. Then on the other hand I see the company is mooning since 2024 and japan is pushing for corporate reforms so there is a chance. || If you concentrate your portfolio into fewer stocks you have a higher risk but also get higher returns.

Ex. If i bought nvidia pre split at 500$ a share ($50 equivalent in post split), and i bought 1k of it (2 shares pre split, 20 now), id now have $1740 in return. If i did the same with the s&p or an index id have less. If i made my own index with >15 stocks and the other stocks didnt perform as well (which is likely) id be losing out on profits

Keep in mind, the example is a bad idea too, you shouldnt only own 1 stock, just explaining the concept with a slight hyperbole || Understandable. Not hating just having a laugh || Haha hope you’re still friends with that friend, he’s only trying to help. I would stay overweight on U.S. equities, and would only consider emerging/developed markets if the U.S. economy/market weakens. That said, the world shakes when the U.S. sneezes. Africa will have its time but that’s decades away. And also, just because the economy of a country improves significantly, doesn’t mean you’ll be able to capture the gain through the public markets. SSE Composite Index (Shanghai) is only up 380% all time, dating back to 1995. Chinese people got wealthy through real estate, not stock. || For individual investors, for the long term, I would highly consider the Magnificent 7 stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, Google, Amazon, Tesla). They all have a CAGR that is higher than the S&P 500 the past decade. ANY percentage higher that you can get more than the market is extremely valuable, as those returns will compound over time. 

When Apple became the most valuable company in the world in 2012, and you invested in 100k in it, you would have $965,552 today versus $346,234. Apple’s CAGR is 25.69% and S&P 500 is 13.34%. Sometimes the best way to make money is right in front of you. Most people don’t realize that. Most people are underinvested in Nvidia. They think that Nvidia is too expensive and that the train already passed. Sure the best momentum has passed, but the growth is still getting started.

These companies have such strong economic moats, and people underestimate their globalization effects (everyone and their mom is using American technology). These will only compound.

Short term these stocks are definitely volatile but with a buy and hold strategy, you should outperform the market over an extended period unless a huge disruption takes market share. My picks for today are something like (50% NVDA, 30% GOOGL, 10% AMZN, 10% META). TSLA/AAPL/MSFT don’t have attractive valuations for me at the moment || It may take longer than you anticipate for a pullback to occur. It takes humility in saying that you don’t know when the next pullback will happen. Best to stay invested. If you have cash when pullback happens, add then. || I am doing analysis and DD, but ofc not every day for every company. Daily I’m just looking at news, with a deeper dig every quarter or if some big news comes. 

These are positions built over a year, not all bought in the same day. So I have had pelts of time to choose. || Thanks man.  I am pretty tech heavy, but on other hand I personally think that the tech stocks that I have are still at a pretty fair valuation and I believe in their continued growth in the future. But I am definitely also looking to add more outside tech. 

I like the mix of blue chip stocks that i feel can still outperform the market as a base, and some smaller stocks as potential high flyers. This also leaves me some more time to really lean about the smaller companies, as I can look at the blue chips once in a while and judge if my investment case still stands. While on the other hand the smaller stocks are more “engaging”, and you can’t just be passive. 

Procter and Gamble i have as my ultra safe stock, which makes the red days a tiny bit better while it has still performed pretty decently. || I think it’s better to take risk earlier in life, my time horizon i longer and it’s not gonna impact me if I loose 40% like it would if I had a house and family. And yes I did start in a bull market, but I would not bring It all down to just luck. I am lucky to be surrounded by people who have great knowledge about stocks who have also helped me learn. 
Even if you take the outliers, worst and best performer out i would have still outperformed. I like that I can take a higher risk than if I bought and index, even though that probably will lead to underperformance i bear markets, it will hopefully lead to outperformance in bull markets. || Long-term, I expect it to double at minimum. || It's expensive according to as-reported metrics (~31x P/E). I'm saying it's a lot less expensive than what those suggest. MHVFY's real P/E is around 6x. || Sure, but my strategy is more akin to buying multiple lottery tickets, somewhat more like investing in startups, but I guess I should put more into Rheinmetal etc. || So, do you think it is the best solution to sell off all individuals and buy some ETFs? (or TB, in case the market falls) || Thanks, I appreciate you spending time reviewing and giving advice. || I agree with this strategy. Be more aggressive early in life and transition to ETFs later in life after you've built a significant nest egg. Just be sure to diversify. I lost six figures in my twenties (401k) when the tech bubble burst. It was a fun ride on the way up but took 10+ years to recover. || [deleted] || Also I noticed there’s multiple related tickers. Do you by chance know what MHVYF and MHVIY are? || If you're trying to establish a stake in convexity setups, then your allocation needs to be weighted to reflect the risk/reward tradeoff. The principal distribution feels very random. || If I knew the best solution I'd be doing it. Personally, I'd stick to 1-3 ETFs for at least 80% of the portfolio. Playing with the other 80% is fine but I wouldn't waste time having less than, say, a thousand bucks in a company. Anything less and even if it doubles you're not seeing much of a gain || Of course! || [removed] || MHVIY looks like an unsponsored ADS. MHVYF is probably the ADR. || I do put in different amounts depending on risk and my belief in them, so i have Jumia for a small sum and Rheinmetal for more || Thank you for your reply. At first I bought individuals with a quarter of my cash (the rest went into ETFs). But thanks to the rising market, my portfolio was distorted. I know I should follow your advice, but I want to gain experience and knowledge of the market rather than profit. Fortunately, even if I invest 80% of my money exposed to the market, there will be more than $10,000 left. Then I would like to get ideas on how to improve my portfolio.

  
I've already decided to sell what we call meme stocks, but there will be more than 40 brands. That's what I feel it problematic. || [deleted] || Gotcha thanks. What brokerage do you use if you don’t mind me asking? || Yeah that's fair. Also remember you can paper trade and that way your money isn't at risk and your learning experiences don't potentially push back your retirement. 

You could always look for exits in the ones you aren't as optimistic about anymore. I personally cap the total number of stocks in my portfolio to about 10 but it's flexible. Try to avoid developing an emotional attachment to any of them. If you had to rank them right now, the bottom 20 should be easy sells sometime in the next year. From there you can take time to really do you due diligence on the remaining ones and rebalance as needed || Why comment something that does not matter? I asked for opinions on my portifolio, and now you start to generalize, why comment if you have nothing meaningful to say about what I ask? || E-Trade. || [deleted] || Weird I don’t see MHVFY on my E trade either? Do you know which would be the equivalent to your ticker?"

Amazon sued by DC attorney general for allegedly excluding neighborhoods from Prime delivery,"Washington, D.C.’s attorney general sued Amazon on Wednesday, accusing the company of covertly depriving residents in certain ZIP codes in the nation’s capital from access to Prime’s high-speed delivery.

The lawsuit from AG Brian Schwalb alleges that, since 2022, Amazon has “secretly excluded” two “historically underserved” D.C. ZIP codes from its expedited delivery service while charging Prime members living there the full subscription price. Amazon’s Prime membership program costs $139 a year and includes perks like two-day shipping and access to streaming content.

“Amazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide,” Schwalb said in a statement. “While Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one zip code is worth less than a dollar in another.”

In June 2022, Amazon allegedly stopped using its own delivery trucks to shuttle packages in the ZIP codes 20019 and 20020 based on concerns over driver safety, the suit states. In place of its in-house delivery network, the company relied on outside carriers like UPS and the U.S. Postal Service to make deliveries, according to the complaint, which was filed in D.C. Superior Court.

The decision caused residents in those ZIP codes to experience “significantly longer delivery times than their neighbors in other District ZIP codes, despite paying the exact same membership price for Prime,” the lawsuit says.

Data from the AG shows that before Amazon instituted the change, more than 72% of Prime packages in the two ZIP codes were delivered within two days of checkout. That number dropped to as low as 24% following the move, while two-day delivery rates across the district increased to 74%.

Amazon has faced prior complaints of disparities in its Prime program. In 2016, the company said it would expand access to same-day delivery in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Washington, after a Bloomberg investigation found Black residents were “about half as likely” to be eligible for same-day delivery as white residents.

The ZIP codes in Schwalb’s complaint are in areas with large Black populations, according to 2022 Census data based on its American Community Survey.

The Federal Trade Commission also sued Amazon in June 2023, accusing the company of tricking consumers into signing up for Prime and “sabotaging” their attempts to cancel by employing so-called dark patterns, or deceptive design tactics meant to steer users toward a specific choice. Amazon said the complaint was “false on the facts and the law.” The case is set to go to trial in June 2025.

According to Scwalb’s complaint, Amazon never communicated the delivery exclusion to Prime members in the area. When consumers in the affected ZIP codes complained to Amazon about slower delivery speeds, the company said it was due to circumstances outside its control, the suit says.

The lawsuit accuses Amazon of violating the district’s consumer protection laws. It also asks the court to “put an end to Amazon’s deceptive conduct,” as well as for damages and penalties.

To get packages to customers’ doorsteps, Amazon uses a combination of its own contracted delivery companies, usually distinguishable by Amazon-branded cargo vans, as well as carriers like USPS, UPS and FedEx, and a network of gig workers who make deliveries from their own vehicles as part of its Flex program.

Amazon has rapidly expanded its in-house logistics army in recent years as it looks to speed up deliveries from two days to one day or even a few hours. In July, the company said it recorded its “fastest Prime delivery speeds ever” in the first half of the year, delivering more than 5 billion items within a day.

In relying on its own workforce, Amazon has assumed greater control over its delivery operations.

In his complaint, Schwalb cites an internal company policy that says Amazon may choose to exclude certain areas from being served by its in-house delivery network if a driver experiences “violence, intimidation or harassment.” The company relies on UPS or USPS to deliver packages in excluded areas.

Amazon for taking the money. Or the lawyer suing because Amazon won’t send its underpaid workers into harms way to deliver someone’s socks fast enough. Jesus wept. || Next up : Chinese and pizza restaurants sued for not delivering to the people who keep robbing them || They really are trying to sue mag 7 for literally anything || Imagine actually policing these areas instead of suing Amazon for not being willing to get robbed. || Interesting - I used to live in 20019 - its a 'pre-gentrified' neighborhood/ward but very diverse - Some of it is very 'suburban', wider streets, craftsman style houses. There is a concentrated area downtown which has a number of apartment high rises and some shops. And there are some larger projects (notably Kenilworth in 20019 and Barry Frams in 20020), which although I ventured into a number of times, are....rough.

Its a really complex problem. Its in part of DC called 'East of the (Anacostia) River' or EOTR. And has historically been an impoverished black part of the city. Even in the 90s when all of DC was rough, this area was the worst of the worst. And because of the river its remained sectioned off, and even despite investments from DC, has been the slowest to proper in the thriving DC. The same reason that Amazon doesnt want to deliver there is the same reason its a food desert - crime. The most egregious corporate offender though was Walmart who agreed to put 2? stores in 20019 and 20020 back in \~2017 if memory serves in exchange for puting stores in more affluent parts of DC. They built the stores they wanted and then reneged on the 2 others, and saw no consequences.

I understand why Amazon doesn't feel like its safe to deliver there, but I had prime when I lived there, and it helped tremendously to offset the food/shopping desert. There needs to be stronger representation (Trayon White down in 20020 for example is a criminal who keeps getting relected), and more advocacy groups need to be vocal about the issues in this part of DC.

I know this is a stock sub - this will be an immaterial lawsuite for amazon - but its a major social and political issue that many urban areas across the country face. These large companies need to be held at least somewhat accountable to provide equal services, they certainly get preferential treatment in our society, they should be helping to solve these issues not contributing to them, they certainly have the capital to do so.

Quick note: I loved living in 20019 - understanding that I have a different perspective I am privileged (good income, white male) - the neighborhood was warm and welcoming, we would help each other out, and there were many genuinely kind people. I would not hesitate to return at a different stage in life. || Bullish || I wonder why the DA isn’t trying to solve the root cause of this issue (crime) rather than the symptom (companies trying to avoid crime). 

If crime in those zip codes got on par with others it seems like that would be a resolve all of the issues and many more. || Charging for a service they're not providing is wrong.  But not wanting to deliver packages in SE DC, totally understandable.  

Source:  I grew up in this area || Amazon should counter sue stating that DC has failed Ward 7 and 8 residents by not providing basic safety policing to ensure companies like Amazon and their workers feel safe to deliver packages. || Not surprising, but definitely disappointing. || I expect this to open up to a class action at some point. Amazon does this all over the country, and not just in high crime areas. I'm in a gated community and for the last 2 years, I haven't received a single package in less than 4 days. I actually stopped ordering from Amazon because ordering direct from the actual company almost always ships faster || DC AG. Instead of fixing the problem. He is going after Amazon. || It's not just there and not just because of the drivers being robbed.  This was a business decision made by Amazon. They do this in less populated regions all over the US.  I live in central Florida in a gated community and about 2 years ago they started doing this.  I can't get anything delivered in less than 4-5 days. || While The System laughs in the corner. || Big difference when they're subscribing to Amazon Prime but get less of the benefits. It's a bad situation all around though. || It’s their new checkbook. || issue here is Amazon charging these people for prime,.don't offer it in the non covered zip codes || It's almost like D.C. should focus on reducing crime in those areas rather than getting upset about food deserts and lack of Prime shipping.

Capitalism works really well -- make those areas attractive to do business in, and the food deserts will disappear. When crime is allowed to run rampant, no one should be shocked that businesses choose to do business elsewhere.

The circa-2020 activism pushing the idea that ""policing crime is bad, actually"" has done and continues to do irreparable harm to cities. Prosecute crime the fullest extent of the law, and put criminals in jail. It's really that simple. || Our taxes pay for our police subscription though. || yup, Amazon should exclude not safe neighborhoods ez fix but looks bad lol, does USPS have the issue there? || You're living up to your username I see. 

I think there are certainly reforms needed in DCs justice system - especially as it relates to juveniles - but EOTR is a textbook definition of systemic racism in America. When people who have mostly lived in affluent neighborhoods or at least more suburban white communities try and poo-poo the concept of systemic racism (oh blacks gonna black, or 'they can vote, racism isnt a thing anymore') Its because they havent been exposed to places where its truly an issue.

Ward 7/8 (these zip codes) was literally sectioned off from the rest of DC by a river...then they added major highways to further section it off. It was the (literal) city dump for decades, had a powerplant that contaminated the river (still recovering) that people used to sustain themselves. Police wouldn't police the area for decades. There were open air drug markets. The schools received zero investment. Its created lost generations of kids/adults and a cycle of poverty that cant be broken by 'hur dur more police'. || Exactly Amazon should sue DC to require them to uphold basic standards of safety that the rest of DC enjoys that allows companies like Amazon to deliver packages. || Poor people dont pay much taxes. || Robbing/attacking a mailman is a felony and will completely destroy your life lol, I assume amazon delivery workers do not have the same protections. || This is true. But they pay for Amazon prime apparently. || good point! Man if USPS gets privitized the poor people really will never be able to vote..."
Whats going on with the french index?,"Let's talk about the french CAC 40 index.

CAC has underperformed in 2024 compared to other EU indexes. || Dunno about France, but look at which German stocks are doing well and are the DAX’ largest contributors and you‘ll know why the DAX is fine.

SAP is basically tech and global, Deutsche Telekom is solely driven by T-Mobile US, Siemens is global and US is doing fine, lots of insurers, reinsurers, a few banks and defense. Not really constituents of the „common man economy“. A huge chunk of German economic output comes from small/mid private companies („Mittelstand“).

Iirc France is huge in defense and aerospace, so that might be a reason for them as well. || Look at the Romanian stock market,it literally crashed since an nazi using TickTok won the first round for presidecy,never before something similar happened.

Turned out to be a magnificent obesrevation, really. Same precedences will follow for the movement of DAX. || Oh so, it’s not only the S&P500 that seems like a bubble right now!? || I dont think barnier's fall was priced in, up until a week ago there were talks of negotiations being made with le pen's RN, so it really wasnt sure up until a few days ago, but now its 100% sure || Epic comparison || Top comment || The dax ""Kursindex"" is on all time high as well - so dividends aren't the reason. Better explanation is certainly that a) Dax is only loosely attached to german economy (buying dax is more a call on world economy) and b) stockmarkets and economy are more and more parting ways in general (which should be sign of concern) || it's they everything bubble || What mattered was the snap élection call from Macron on the 9th of june and the result on july. Can’t govern with 3 parties. || In a political system where the president has most of the power and the prime minister position is basically jackshit I don't think uncertainty around the prime minister's positions would move a market."
"GM expects more than $5 billion impact from China restructuring, including plant closures","General Motors expects a restructuring of its joint venture operations with SAIC Motor Corp. in China to cost more than $5 billion in non-cash charges and writedowns, the Detroit automaker disclosed in a federal filing Wednesday morning.

GM said it expects to write down the value of its joint-venture operations in China by between $2.6 billion and $2.9 billion. It also anticipates another $2.7 billion in charges to restructure the business, including “plant closures and portfolio optimization,” according to the filing.

GM, which previously announced plans to restructure the operations in China, did not disclose any additional details about the expected closures.

“As we have consistently said, we are focused on capital efficiency and cost discipline and have been working with SGM to turn around the business in China in order to be sustainable and profitable in the market. We are close to finalizing our restructuring plan with our partner, and we expect our results in China in 2025 to show year-over-year improvement,” GM said in an emailed statement.

GM said it believes the joint venture “has the ability to restructure without new cash investments” from the American automaker.

A majority of the restructuring costs is expected to be recognized as non-cash, special item charges during the fourth quarter. That means they will impact the automaker’s net income, but not its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes – a key metric monitored by Wall Street.

GM’s operations in China have shifted from a profit engine to liability in the past decade as competition grows from government-backed domestic automakers fueled by nationalism, and as a generational shift in consumer perceptions of the automotive industry and electric vehicles takes hold.

Equity income from GM’s Chinese operations and joint ventures peaked at more than $2 billion in 2014 and 2015.

GM’s market share in China, including its joint ventures, has plummeted from roughly 15% as recently as 2015 to 8.6% last year — the first time it has dropped below 9% since 2003. GM’s equity income from the operations have also fallen, down 78.5% since peaking in 2014, according to regulatory filings.

GM’s U.S.-based brands such as Buick and Chevrolet have seen sales drop more than its joint venture sales with SAIC Motor, Wuling Motors and others. The joint venture models accounted for about 60% of its 2.1 million vehicles sold last year in China.

Prior to this year, the only quarterly losses for GM in China since 2009 were a $167 million shortfall during the first quarter of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic and an $87 million loss during the second quarter of 2022.

The Detroit automaker has reported three consecutive quarterly losses in equity income for its Chinese operations this year, totaling $347 million. That includes a loss of $137 million during the third quarter.

Let this be a warning to any automakers with market exposures in places without barriers to Chinese cars. 

Every automakers will be affected in coming years. Tesla (continuous margin shinkage competing against Chinese EVs), Toyota (heavy exposure in Asian market with no trade barrier against Chinese EVs), Volkswagen (Chinese market), etc. 

Also if you only turtle in few protected markets (like the US), the companies will lose competitiveness and economy of scale, making you further lag behind the Chinese EVs. 

What a missed opportunity by the US because corporations were too busy protecting their margins selling overpriced ICE vehicles and Republicans were busy waging culture war against EVs. || Does the Chinese government get rights to any IP and other technology when produced in China?

Name a large-cap stock and its small-cap competitor ,"I am always looking for small/mid-cap companies that have a similar business model or product as large cap competitors! 

I’ll start by naming a few (large-cap and small-cap) companies: 

- CRWD and S
- COST and BJ
- KR and SFM
- CMG and CAVA 
- MNST and CELH
- SBUX and BROS 
- Space X and RKLB (count it) 

I always love seeing the small caps slowly take a piece of the pie from the big boys. It’s what capitalism is all about. Especially fun to see when the little guy has a better product. I think this is the case for almost all of the companies I listed. If they aren’t flat out better, they offer something slightly different, or are better in a certain way. 

These smaller cap stocks are obviously a bigger risk, since a lot of them still are not making money, but the growth is very appealing. 

Would love to hear some comparisons like this and an explanation as to why you think the smaller company is better, or will continue to grow.

They are also Rivian closer to becoming sustainable, but they also had so many rich backers. For that reason, i think the company has a lot of bloat already, and they aren't yet close to being profitable. While laid is further off, they have not yet had that inflow of rich backers. So if they do end up getting them, they will be a leaner and meaner version of rivian. Totally depends on you risk tolerance for sure but higher risk will also have higher reward. || Purely anecdotal, but I have seen a good amount of Rivian’s being I see about one a day on the road versus I’ve seen maybe five Lucid in my entire life || No, some shit law firm saw blood with the 40% drop. 

Their MOA is the same as Tirzipetide (LLY product) and consequently has nearly identical results (some may argue better). 

The 40%+ drop is mainly due to the fact that there are mfg concerns. NVO and LLY have suffocated supply for the next 3 years with massive spend. However this would only need to be for the 2.5-15mg dose injectible NOT for their 100mg oral product which is a few yrs behind. VKTX has 900M in the bank that needs to get them through P3 trials and launch. This is doable.

With this week's Amgen data being suboptimal, Merck trying to get into the obesity game with a ""differentiated"" product and keytruda coming off patent in 2 years, and Pfizer desperate for a cash cow after awful acquisitions, VKTX is looking like a prime candidate for at least a partnership if they don't attempt to push this alone. 

If they go alone expecting 10B in annual revenue is not a lofty goal. 

LLY already tried to buy at $50/share. 

You are likely witnessing a coordinated attack to cool the stock. But to think this is a given 3x bagger is foolish. || Pretty much every publicly traded company faces class action suits and investigations by law firms. For biopharma specifically, since trial results are huge catalysts for large swings in their stock prices it is extremely common for them to face class action suits and investigations following positive/ negative results announcements. Especially for small, pre-revenue firms with volatile stock prices.

In the case of Viking, their stock price saw a huge bump  of ~10% when they announced very positive results for the oral version of their drug which is still in Phase 1 currently. An analyst expressed skepticism over their ability to eventually produce the drug at scale due to high costs and expertise requirements. So the investigation that opened is looking into whether they adequately disclosed production capabilities since the stock price and ‘perceived value” of the firm went up. 

not very concerning, and pretty much par for the course with these type of companies. Drug is in phase I so a long way from market. Their subcutaneous injection version is further along in clinical trials having recently concluded phase II and will be a bigger catalyst for them in the near-er term. Also, sell-side analysts are notoriously horrible at evaluating smaller biopharma firms. || Technically Lucid had some of the richest backers… the Saudis. They own nearly half of the damn company now! || True, but like 12.5% of rivian is also owned by some Saudi guy. Honestly, if rivian didn't burn so much cash, I would perfer them to lucid || ""I really want to get a Lucid""

Tesla CEO Elon Musk loses bid to get $56 billion pay package reinstated,"A Delaware judge ruled on Monday that Tesla, CEO Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a $56 billion compensation package despite shareholders of the electric vehicle company voting to reinstate it.The ruling by the judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, follows her January decision that called the pay package excessive and rescinded it, surprising investors, and cast uncertainty over Musk's future at the world's most valuable carmaker.

Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for Musk, the company's driving force who is responsible for many of its advances, and reinstate his compensation.McCormick also ordered Tesla to pay the attorneys who brought the case $345 million, well short of the billions they initially requested.

Because he took his company public and sold shares of it to the public, it now falls under the purview of the legal system.  He can work with the court to get paid, but the court now has a say in how things are done.  The legal system can hold companies accountable, even if their stock holders would rather they not.  

If Musk repurchase the outstanding shares, he can make Tesla private. || $56B is well over a billion a week which works out to $25m per hour. I agree with the judge. A bit excessive at $7k per second. || How is a judge being able to block shareholder decisions like this? || ITT, all the troll farms from the election reactivated to try to get Elon a payout after illegally colluding with the board of directors. || How can a judge decide what’s “excessive” but then decide that awarding the attorneys $345 million isn’t?  Seems excessive to me. || Full disclaimer: not an Elon fan boy, you’re welcome to browse my history. 

This decision, first and now second time is beyond asinine. 

When this compensation package was voted in, it was a literal laughing stock of an idea. You can still YouTube the CNBC clips. 

The targets were so far out of the money it was an absolute slam dunk for the shareholders.  There was no one except for Elon that thought this was a good idea. 

So to then revise this because Elon managed to hit these absolutely ridiculous targets is absolutely absurd and incorrect. 

I completely disagree with these decisions. || The shocking thing for me is that the courts are taking this action, but it seems Elon can get away with massive stock price manipulation through his hugely misleading public statements for years. || The myth of consensual compensation:

Elon: I consent

Shareholders: I consent

Judge: I don’t 

Is there somebody you forgot to ask? || [removed] || Idiot's trying to cover his $44B losses from buying and ruining Twitter || I hate Musk as much as the next guy, but how can a judge overrule what owners of a company pays their CEO?

The shareholders collectively agreed via a vote to approve the compensation package, how can any judge overrule this? What law is being broken here? I am honestly confused... || The ruling raises serious questions about shareholder rights. If a majority of shareholders voted to approve a pay package, how can a judge nullify that decision? It feels like a dangerous precedent where courts can override the will of the owners, undermining the very essence of public companies. Shouldn't the shareholders have the final say in how their company is run? || The judge thinks the pay package is excessive yet then awards attorneys over 300 million... The fuck lol || Lol. Vote passed overwhelmingly twice. But judge says nah. Lol.

We gotta vote again it seems. || Question to shareholders that voted in favor of passing this package. 

Why? || That a judge can call a pay package “excessive” and nullify it on those grounds AFTER the initial problems were fixed with a 2nd shareholder vote is actually scary.  || This is why we nees regulation.  The judge made the right decision || The happy ending. Hope this shit is done for good. || CEOs literally running companies into the ground and getting billion dollar parachutes and a direct referral to a C suite position at another company and the US court system is going after a man who manufactures the most successful electric vehicles on the market, runs a rocket company that dickslaps NASA incompetency in the face and people in this thread are really going to argue this decision isn’t anything but ugly malice from a personally or politically driven individual, unworthy of her position.

Regardless of your sentiments of Musk as a personality, he has not only grown Tesla into a behemoth electric car manufacturer, he’s done more to catapult the US as a nation forward technologically than very few individuals in history. The Federal government should be kissing his feet with the contribution he has made to this country, far more value than this pathetic judge or the representatives in congress with a chip on their shoulder about him. || So many people in the comments are so full of jealousy and hatred. This verdict to overrule a 72% majority vote from shareholders stinks of corruption and/or major bias. If you think anything about this is fair I worry about you. || I voted no on this. Fuck that. What a waste of money. || Good, I voted no. Hes got enough money. Use the money to buy back tesla shares and help raise the price to $400 || Don‘t worry. He has a job that keep him busy at least next 4yrs or the minute he get bored of getting rid of goverment department. || That’s fine. ( & don’t gimme that, “ what if you earned* $56k & a judge took it away, f.K.  Leon) || So sad! Anyway! || Keep in mind, shareholders who didn’t vote, all thier votes are counted as “for” Elon || This ruling against Elon Musk’s $56 billion pay package could be a wake-up call for corporate governance and executive compensation practices

IMO this is a reminder that no one, not even a visionary CEO, is above scrutiny. It also highlights a growing concern over the gap between executive pay and company performance.

It risks alienating Musk, whose vision and leadership are central to Tesla. Any uncertainty about his future involvement could spook investors. But the good, the decision could push Tesla to adopt a more balanced compensation structure, reassuring critics and promoting better governance. || 😂 || His house is made of straw. || I hope Musk follows through on his threat to move to other companies. (spoiler alert; He won't) || I guess the next move will be to reincorporate in Texas. || Startups wont automatically incorporate in Delaware after a ruling like this. Delaware is the one that will be losing long term. It will be too risky to do business in that environment where judges can go rogue. || Repeat after me, Tesla is a tech company not a carmaker. || Good || Hahaha || Nice, well deserved || Aren’t there limit for managerial remuneration?? I can see it in billions but it must be within certain limits?? || Good || I hate Musk as much as the next guy and it’s definitely excessive, but it’s insane that a judge can just make a ruling on a company even against the shareholders votes. 

People keep saying stuff about “the law”, does anyone know which specific law(s) prevent a public company from paying an executive an excessive amount? Obviously if it was private it wouldn’t matter. || lmao de\_stroyed fuck him || A corporation’s board is supposed to be independent, advocate for the shareholders, and provide oversight of the CEO.  In this case, Tesla has  Elon and his brother and Elon Stans as the board.   Hard to argue they are acting in the interest of the company/shareholders awarding 56B to the CEO.  They could do a massive stock buyback and give Elon and everyone else a payday with that 56B.  It just wouldn’t be wildly obscene, just obscene. || I think the whole thing is dumb. Judge shouldnt overreach. But i also think musk is overboard/greedy. The company / share holdwr got him super rich to where next 10 or 100 generation would be well off. He should focus on taking care of the com0amy/share holders, not try to greedily take as much as he can, threats, demand, etc || Crazy to see people supporting this when it’s textbook weaponization of the justice system || Leon held a gun to TSLA shareholders' heads to get them to vote ""Yes"" back in June. Whatever will he do now with his new political power? || I always wonder why pay package is used as the press wording. Compensation package (in the form of stock options) sound way less misleading in this case. || This judge needs to be investigated. Ill start by saying if I was a shareholder of Tesla, I would have voted ""HELL NO"" to this compensation as I don't think its even close to in the benefit of the shareholders. However, the shareholders voted two times to approve this pay package. The fact that a judge can overrule the owners of a company for how much they want to pay its CEO is absolutely absurd and should be immediately appealed. || Where were the judges when I'm holding JCP bonds and the executive board paid themselves out millions as the company went bankrupt? We didn't get to vote on it either... || Lmao good job,while he’s paying his staff rubbish wages and union busting he doesn’t deserve anything close to this,all he does is snort ket and tweet anyway || Say what you will, but at the time the price targets of the pay package were absurd. I despise Musk, but he managed to hit those all of those milestones. I think they should pay him every penny. || It's 1 thing to deny Elon the pay package (which he deserves). It's another thing to award the lawyers 345 million. || Justice served to someone finally.  I am tired of these arrogant manipulative fraudulent people getting away with things.  May Elon and Tesla fail or get taken over by someone more ethical. || Very interesting, thanks for linking. I spent more time than I expected to reading through it. || That is so high is just sounds like a made up number. People actually make that much like wtf. || ""Well short of the billions they originally sought."" 😳 || A huge part of the decision goes into how they settled on this number. Based on the way fees are normally allocated for cases like this, $345M is actually very low, and so most of that text is spent explaining how/why it was being lowered.  
   
It's probably worth keeping in mind that this is 0.3% of the sum that hangs in the balance here. The pay package effectively grants $100B to Elon. The stakes are big when it's a shitload of money on the line. || Didn’t he win retail investors? I thought it was like the big institutional guys like pension funds and hedge funds that voted against || He’s skipping around like a dipshit || Because that’s how stock market works? You want more say own more shares.Not  to mention retail voted overwhelmingly FOR the package, so your point makes no sense. || “Funding secured” || Pretty reductive.

By that logic… no public company can ever have its shareholders decide on anything. Look… I despise Elon Musk and I think the pay package is obscene, but an overwhelming majority of shareholders supported the pay package. If 72% of shareholders (yes, that was the actual percentage) want to be idiotic and donate their equity to Elon Musk, I don’t see how a judge can stop them. I see this as judicial overreach.

Tesla might be a public company, but at the end of the day this is a private matter between Tesla and its shareholders. It seems the shareholders… are happy?

BTW I was against the pay package before the June vote because I didn’t think it was fair that Tesla’s current shareholders be bound to something the 2018 shareholders approved, but they approved it overwhelmingly in June 2024, so I don’t see the issue. || A private company doesn't ""fall under the purview of the legal system""??? 

""The court now has a say in how things are done""???

1) All Corporations fall under the purview of the legal system. 

2) A court always has a say in how things are done, as it concerns legally binding contracts, shareholder rights, etc.

3) People in private companies sue each other all the time. || If the shareholders vote for something how does the court overrule it?

Isn’t the shareholders voting over 50% already? Why do their votes not count?

Mostly just curious because this seems wild to me || Yes, now do Boeing, Intel, ATT and all the rest of them. || Why would you think that privately held companies are immune to litigation?  || Since almost all his wealth is because of his Tesla shares, I don't see how that could be a viable solution for him. || Now that he's suddenly buddy buddy with Trump, I'm sure he will try to weasle his way around the ruling. || That doesn’t sound right. The only legal requirements that really change are the ones about accountability, reporting and transparency. There is no sudden cap on executive benefits because a company is public. If there was shouldn’t his board have already denied the request? || This will go to the supreme court (which is repub favoured) and will be shut down || Well said. || most the board members are related somehow. they hold millions of shares between them, almost more than whats outstanding, also the compensation package is for shares of Tesla, at a undervalued price. || Can also go to scotus which would resolve this. Considering his bff is the new president, I doubt this issue sticks long || Musk was not one of the founders of Tesla.  It is not “his company”.   He bought a majority of ownership shares in 2004.  He became CEO in 2008.   || [deleted] || Regardless of your theory of ownership, this won't pass supreme court muster as it interferes with a legal decision about how to invest a corporation's money in a legal pursuit.  It is in effect a taking. 

What is the limiting or controlling rule? What dollar amount is too much to pay a CEO? || No. Judges can’t make arbitrary decisions from the bench. This is way over the line, and its obvious this is one of those wack job liberal judges who just doesn’t like the guy. || Thats's approximately half of Tesla's profit since its inception. || Damn. An extra 7k a YEAR would be game-changing for me. || Wrong, that's for 1 year.

This pay package is from 2018-present, so 7 years. || the amount is irrelevant, the deal was for him to get 'paid' in a certain amount of stock.  we wouldn't be having this discussion if the stock was $50. || But this pay package isn’t salary or cash. It’s stock options, ie increased ownership of Tesla.

Musk gets 0 salary from his position as CEO.  || Well when you take a 100m company and turn it into a 1T company, how much of that growth do you deserve? || Since he'd get nothing without achieving what people called impossible, the real worth was: p(impossible)*56B


This was an extremely good deal for the shareholders, since even if they had to pay, achieving the impossible would have made them a filthy net profit.


That was the opinion of EVERYONE at the time. Even the Musk haters just ridiculed his delusions. That a judge can decide otherwise by taking the impossible achievement for granted is blatantly corrupt.  || Jesus Christ, it would be like an IRL tycoon game. WTF || How much isn’t the issue. It shouldn’t matter . You can’t arbitrarily decide when to make these rulings based on some amount or wealth of the person. || [deleted] || A shareholder vote doesn't supercede the law.

The original package was rescinded, you can't overrule a court decision with a shareholder vote.

They could have voted for a new package but because Musk didn't want to get reamed on the taxes that would involve, he tried to push through a 'reinstatement' of the original package. || Like all things, this is far more complicated than Redditors are appreciating and you’re not going to understand it if you only read headlines. There is a legitimate legal issue with how the original pay package was established, which is to say it was done fraudulently. Of course a Judge can stop a company from doing something that is fraudulent, even if its shareholders think it’s ok. || Because there's laws to protect stupid people from their stupid decisions for their own good || It's minority shareholder rights. If you own 51% of a company and vote to write yourself an unreasonably large check for no reason the other 49% needs recourse. || Because there's protection in place to prevent majority shareholders from screwing the minority shareholders and these ideas go all the way back to the beginning of the 20th century where the courts ruled that Henry Ford wasn't allowed to screw the Dodge brothers. Elon Musk should have known the rules of the game before he started playing. The board and majority shareholders need to stop these ridiculous compensation packages that are diluting minority holders beyond reason. || I take my company public with a float of 49% (I still own 51%.) I own half the board seats, and a quarter are my buddies. We send it for a vote on whether I can get paid 100x the going rate for a salary of a ceo for a company my size (aka pseudo embezzle any profits to avoid paying shareholders.) I vote (51%) and maybe 20% of the other people actually proxy vote, so it gets passed by a landslide. 
Judge calls shenanigans. 
Oversimplified but scenarios like that. || The judge ruled in favor of the initial plaintiffs  who sued claiming that the compensation was excessive and against their interests as shareholders.   Today they ruled that the attempt to create facts after the matter had been ruled against Tesla’s board of directors and Musk was a violation existing rules and precedents. || Tesla is publicly traded and granting an exorbitant pay package is not in line with a company taking its fiduciary duty to investors seriously. || They won’t be able to for long. Trump admin about to make this judge disappear. || Some Shareholders sued to overturn the original board decision the shareholders voters approved. 

The shareholders who sued, sued on the basis that the deal the board wasn’t in the best interest of the company. The deal was overturned for breaking the law is Massachusetts.  

Musk moved Tesla’s corporate office to Texas and had a vote to say tesla shareholders think the original deal should be reinstated. 

The judge has said, a shareholder vote can’t over turn the law and Tesla must pay the lawyer fees.

Musk could now bring a new vote with a whole new payment package but that would have to be voted on separately from the previously voted on package. || Don't worry, it's fine to step over the boundaries of the law if it's against someone the internet doesn't like || Why is Elon so selfish that he needs another 56 billion dollars?  More than the company has ever made.  The 56 Billion is better invested in the company than giving it to Elon. || [deleted] || The lawyers made the mistake of asking for billions in compensation rather than trillions || $345 million to the lawyers is fucking insane. || There's a giant space between those two figures. One is $56 billion more. || How can a judge *judge* you mean? || Dude,….exactly.   This whole thing is insane

One party hit the impossible KPIs and growth promises

The people who have their capital on the line agree that a capital investment into their unicorn CEO is a good idea

Yet two seperate parties who have spent their life making arguably negative contributions to society get huge pay days to the benefit of……no one? || This will set precedent that 1 shareholder can sue to veto any corporate vote in the future with the incentive that they could win a big payout. It's going to result in a lot of companies leaving Delaware, because shareholders will not want their votes to be vetoed by a judge who has no stake in the company. They will also not want a bunch of lawsuits representing 1 shareholder, which is completely absurd. || $56 billion is roughly $56 billion more than $345 million || The weird thing is, it's stock options compensation and not cash compensation as it's always suggested by the term ""pay package"", so I bet if Tesla hadn't increased so much in value, this deal would have never been disputed || Elon would be making over a billion or week. That works out to over $7k per second for a 40 hour work week. What do you think about that? Excessive? || > The targets were so far out of the money

You mean the public targets presented to the shareholders.

Remind me of what the board was saying privately again? || The initial pay package was done illegally 

The shareholder vote doesn't change the fact that it was still illegal. It was more of the shareholders acknowledging that the original pay package was illegal but they agree to it.

But it doesn't take away that it was still illegal in the first place. They will need to go back and draw up a new pay package || You can disagree. That doesn’t change anything about the laws that apply and that are to be followed. Elon Musk doesn’t get a pass to do whatever he wants anymore than anybody else.

So, as an investor you should support those decisions, even if you disagree with the outcome, because investors rely on the rule of law to prevail. || Exactly, Elon took an insanely risky bet, then mega delivered. And now people are rewriting history to claim the board was deceived. This is such a waste of time a lawyer fees. || It’s pretty hilarious for you to be so smarmy and definitive when you’ve clearly not read anything except for headlines and maybe watched a CNBC clip. There’s a legitimate legal issue as it relates to the origination of the pay package and how it was approved. This isn’t about hitting targets or denying this package because a judge thinks the total number is too high. Like, literally not even close to what the issue is here. Your comment is extremely naive and your tone makes it embarrassing || Well, unfortunately for you. The law disagrees. Whoops. || pure emotional damage.  musk threads hit so fucking good now. || [removed] || They can agree to a new package but not reinstate the old package. Main difference is taxation || Didn't he Musk taint the vote. Threatening to quit and take part of Tesla's business with him.. all to convince people to approve a ridiculous pay package that was negotiated in bad faith. Basically saying he will tank the company unless he gets his way. || Because it’s a rigged voting.
If you didn’t vote at all, they are all counted as “yes” for the pay package || Have you read anything beyond the headline? If you’re genuinely confused I’m sure you’ve sought some actual information? || Standard is 10%, which would have been much more || Cut down from the billions originally proposed || A shareholder vote doesn't overrule rule the law. || [deleted] || Didn't Musk taint the vote by threatened to leave the company and not develop AI products through Tesla. He basically would tank the company unless he gets a ridiculous pay package negotiated in bad faith. It's not surprising the shareholders wouldn't want that. || Please learn a thing or two about law. || Vote all they want, these “vote” holds as much weight as Twitter votes. People don’t get to ignore the law just because of there’s a “vote”.  

Here’s another example:

Person A agrees to be killed by person B. 

Person B killed Person A

State WILL charge person B of murder regardless if they voted for it or signed an agreement.  || Because love him or hate him Elon has a track record for making a lot of money for investors and Tesla investors want him at the helm and committed to pushing innovation at Tesla. || It takes a special kind of person to invest in an automotive company trading at 98x earnings, that barely grew revenue this year, while most other companies in the same industry are trading at 3-5x earnings. || The initial problems weren't really fixed, and it wouldn't matter if they were. The original package was rescinded, you can't ratify it with a shareholder vote to try and bypass a court ruling.

If they created a new package and fixed all the issues that caused the original to be rescinded, then they could have potentially pushed it through a vote, but they stupidly tried to ratify an already rescinded package.

The only scary thing here is that people think a shareholder vote can let you bypass a court ruling lol. || Initial problems weren't fixed

Shareholder vote was pretty much shareholders voting to acknowledge the original pay package was illegal

Doesn't change the original pay package was still illegal || Those aren’t the grounds, like at all, not even close. And the issues of the first vote weren’t fixed, like at all, not even close. 

How are so many of you so confident on this but seemingly haven’t read a single thing the judge has written??? || It's really crazy. To be honest, I voted against the package because imo it's insane but I think democracy should prevail and if the shareholders voted for it, that's what should happen. It's crazy that a judge can subjectively define what's excessive and nullify a legit vote made by the shareholders || The ruling is on the initial package. You cannot mend evidence this way and present it to the court hoping for a different outcome. || > AFTER the initial problems were fixed 

Wasn't the basis of this that nothing changed other than a shareholder vote where the shareholders were lied to? || As noted in the judges ruling precedent and established rules of the court don’t allow companies to use this as a workaround to a judges ruling.  The plaintiffs (large shareholders) argued the compensation was outrageous, the court agreed.  Then Tesla tried to go back and do an end run around that finding by creating more facts that were not in evidence after the issue had been ruled against Tesla.  If companies could do this then cases would never end, because companies would just keep going back and adding more of this kind of evidence.   
It isn’t actually scary at all.  Unless you are also the CEO of a corporation with a compensation package that has not been properly reviewed. || It’s not. They just have to redo the paperwork.  || Hey get out of here with your reasonable take. Saying ""Elon bad"" is the only way to get guaranteed upvotes over here. || Yeah it's always great when a judge overrules a supermajority of shareholders because they have a personal grudge against a CEO. || That’s usually how shareholder votes work lol || Yes its called lying to shareholders about projections. Telling them one thing, then saying something else internally. This invalidated the original package.

There is nothing stopping them from creating a new package and paying him a trillion dollars but it needs to be a new package, not the one that was already deemed illegal. || The requirement to unlock his pay package was to raise the market value of the company from $50 billion to $650 billion. He did that lmfao || They didn't follow due process, and they've tried to spurn the court at every turn. A shareholder vote can't undo a court ruling lol. || Judge is doing a service to shareholders and you want to take away people that protect shareholders? || Ah yes, the company that single handedly started the EV revolution should fail. So smart. || And then you realize its less than 1% of the total amount Musk would have been paid. A billion dollars is so unfathomable, much less 50 || I should have become a lawyer || “McCormick found that the $5.6 billion fee request by the shareholder’s attorneys, which at one time approached $7 billion based on Tesla’s trading price, went too far.

“In a case about excessive compensation, that was a bold ask,” McCormick wrote.” || The two largest institutional investors, Vanguard and BlackRock, voted [yes](https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2024/07/01/how-tesla-pumped-the-vote), but many others voted no. Retail investors largely voted yes, which isn't surprising. || The boards recommendation was to approve it. Most institutional guys like vanguard and fidelity go with the recommendation. Along with anyone retail who doesn’t vote goes with the recommendation. || “At 420.69 per share” || Aight you know how it went lol || I don't get all the details so I'd love to have it explained where I'm wrong, but I believe the issue is the judge is saying, ""this pay package cannot be approved, because the pay package originates from fraudulent situations in disclosures / board makeup."" They need to make a NEW pay package and vote on it, not try the same one repeatedly, which he doesn't want to do as it exposes him to higher taxes. 

That's my limited (incorrect?) understanding. || Well in fairness large decisions - like a $56bn payout - are indeed decided by shareholders. || You're mischaracterizing what this lawsuit is about. It was initiated by Tesla shareholders, who argue that even though Musk only owns \~20% of Tesla, the entire board is beholden to him and failed to properly negotiate his compensation, as well as misrepresented facts to shareholders before letting them vote on the package.

The latter claim is the root of the issue. || No.

Board members have a fiduciary duty to the shareholders. These board members had conflicts of interest and violated their duties.

Further, Musk Lied to shareholders in the proxy statement leading up to the first vote.

All of that made the foundation of the compensation package fraudulent.

“Here we had another vote” doesn’t mean they:

- cured the issues with the BOD conflicts of interest

- fixed the proxy statements

They didn’t do either. They just… held another vote.

That doesn’t override the fraud and failed fiduciary duties. || The payout was predicated on the shareholders getting a much larger return compared to Musk's compensation.

Not really foolish since Musk is likely the most influential CEO on stock price. If he died tomorrow Tesla shares would sink. || Shareholders aren't God.  They cannot, for example, vote to give 100% of shares outstanding to Elon Musk in return for DogeCoinX.

Very broadly speaking, contract law has minimum standards in place to stop people from being contractually idiotic.  Undue influence can render a contract void, for example.

No matter before a court is ever truly private.  The mere fact that it is before a court is evidence that the private agreement was not adequate to settle all claims. || This seems like it’s overreach because when talked about the situation is boiled down too far for accurate depiction. 

The shareholders have never actually directly approved a $56b pay package. They have approved the board deciding to award the pay package, which the judge has already ruled the board could not do because of how it was all presented. 

The vote was just “should we approve what a judge already ruled illegal?” Which you obviously can’t do. 

Tesla could just bring up the question of the approval directly from shareholders but I’m guessing it’s not simple for one reason or another, which is why they avoided it in the vote || Don't break the law and you won't have to deal with the repercussions? 

Or take the company private and there won't be any of this mess || Any idea what laws or case precedent the court is relying on? || Yeah I gotta agree here. 

The shareholders voted for it.    

I don’t agree with it but it’s not up to me, it should be up to the shareholders. || Assuming the court has a valid legal basis to make the determination, I think a court should decide that $11,600,000* per hour is excessive pay. The court has a duty to all shareholders, including the 28% that voted no, or any that abstained from voting.

* assumed he worked 10 hours a week for 50 weeks on Tesla, given he also runs several other large companies || So let's say for the sake of argument that my friends and I own 51% of the voting shares of a public company. We can now vote to give ourselves an extra 100 million shares and dilute the remaining 49% of shareholders into oblivion? || CEO says: If I achieve the impossible and make you filthy rich, I get a cut, and if I don't, I get nothing.


You seriously claim this is a bad deal for the shareholders? Absolutely no one thought that at the time.  || I don't understand how denying him the package is even up for debate.  Wasn't it a deal he made with the company many years ago that they agreed to if he met certain milestones?  Then he met them all and they decided to not give it to him.  How is that legal? || Based on what I've learned in this thread the TSLA shareholders should unite and vote against the laws of thermodynamics next.

Why should any judge or physicist tell them what do with their own company?? || This particular shareholder vote in this particular jurisdiction doesn't turn an invalid pay package into a valid one. In fact, it's not possible for any shareholder vote to ratify a pay package that was judged to be illegal. || This pay structure is what motivated musk to get Tesla to where it is. 

He set an impossible goal for production rate and sales and stock price.... And then hit those far flung goals.  He deserves to be compensated for success. || No one said they didn’t. But there is additional oversight for public companies that op clearly laid out. Simple concept to grasp. Go be cleverly contrarian somewhere else- maybe r/teenagers. || The board all abstained. The package was approved by outside shareholders only. || They are also making the company to Texas, which makes it mostly moot, because while the case can be tried in Texas again, the governor of Texas is trying to make Texas instead of Delaware the hub for these things precisely on the grounds that Texas courts won’t try this, so the outcome will be pretty predictable. || I don't think it will get out of Deleware. 

The state is heavily funded by corporations and they will leave over this. I don't think they want to be bound by a Supreme Court ruling and will settle this in a way they control. || If that's not how it works please do explain how it does work instead of just saying ""no you're wrong"" || No that is literally how it works and just did work lol. 

If you want to be a public corporation and enjoy the benefits offered by the state in doing so you have to abide by corporate law. || True for most of us I think. If you lined 4 currency counter machines side by side and loaded them up with hundred dollar bills and they each count 1,000 bills per minute for 40 hours, it still will fall well short of what EM is being offered per week.  Excessive? You be the judge. || Upgrade your skills and do it. || He owns like 13% of Tesla shares so you can make the argument he already got his due from that growth. || I think the people who actually took it there, the employees deserve a huge percentage of that. || If you do that alone then you deserve a lot.

If you're the CEO of 4 other companies, ""one of the best diablo players in the world"", a fake government official, and constantly posting on Twitter at all hours then chances are you don't deserve $25M/hr because you're being carried by your employees. || Those are paper gains, though. || Musk is very familiar with “lawfare” as he has been suing everyone using the same 1 judge from Texas who is a Tesla shareholder.

https://www.npr.org/2024/08/09/g-s1-16087/elon-musk-lawsuits-texas-same-judge-hears-them-tesla-stock

lets stop clutching our pearls over that overpaid disgrace of a human being who keeps circumventing laws and manipulating his owns stock (and elections). || The fact that you’re even using the word “lawfare” on what are fairly fundamental corporate law principles that have been around for over a century says it all. || Don't equate the law with what is right.  At times it is flat out wrong. || Is this $56 billion currently reflected in his ownership %, i.e. pay was issued and will be taken away from him or is it the case that if he won on appeal, he'd be given $56 billion in additional stock? || Seems like all you really need is vector and a projectile. || [deleted] || How come there's no such law for Presidential election? 🤔 || No, because there’s laws protecting minority shareholders from the majority || So someone owns 9 shares of Tesla get to tell 90% shareholders how they should vote? Listen to what you wrote. Besides you being butt hurt about Elon getting paid, name another company you invest in that you think this rule should apply. || We voted for the pay package twice, second time with all the info the judge thought we were ""mislead"" to go without. This is simply lawfare. || Which doesn't apply here || (Btw these laws shouldn't exist in a free country) || Did most of the remaining 49% vote in favour of not paying him the package? || The difference is the votes came from normal shareholders and the compensation was fair considering everyone thought the goals were nearly impossible. || And the 56 billion pay bracket is more than what the company is worth, it's more than the sum of all the profits Tesla ever made.
Giving musk 56 billion would destroy the value of the company and leave it with massive debt.
Destroying the company is not good for share holders and thus the judge understands what a 56 billion pay out would do to the company.

But the fact that it was than approved by share holders is also obsured! || What defines exorbitant? When the package was approved it was not worth 56 billion dollars. || ???


This pay is representing an unrealistic moonshot stretch goal that Elon nailed.  Shareholders approved this and now that he reached the goal they take it back??? 


Extremely unethical and at the core negligent towards fiduciary duty || You do realize they're  not just giving him 46 billion dollars? He's just getting shares in the company which are created out of thin air. || The original verdict was well before the election and Musk’s appointment to a fake committee. || Exactly…seems arbitrary and anchored to an original number. || I think you missed his point lol || The board was projecting 2 different scenarios.

Publicly they stated that these numbers were almost impossible to hit.

Privately they projected the numbers were well within reach.

They also convinced shareholders that the pay package was vetted by an independent party, which was not true. The board is full of elon loyalist not tesla loyalists || No, they won't leave. The Delaware Court of Chancery is extremely convenient for corporations and shareholders. You have a better chance at VC funding being incorporated there. || Good things most lawyers will be smart enough to understand why there are rules for public companies || How does that make $345 million not excessive?  The $56 billion was a number voted on twice by the companies shareholders with tangible performance metrics that were exceeded. || Yes that’s excessive too but it’s what the shareholders voted for and he delivered on the results. || No idea. What was the board saying? || Illegal? They projected the growth, everyone but Elon deemed it impossible and the shareholders approved. Its that simple, there was nothing illegal about it. || Illegal, in this lone judge's opinion.

Let's see what judges in higher courts decide upon appeal. || Layers of absurd and needless paperwork, bureaucracy and middlemen. This is what the shareholders want, the government needs to get the hell out of the way and let people do stuff again. || > And now people are rewriting history to claim the board was deceived

I don't know who ""people"" are, but that's not at all the argument being made by the judge. The argument being made is that the board misled shareholders by implying that the milestones needed to hit each tranche were more difficult than the company had calculated internally. It is illegal for the board of a company to mislead its shareholders. || [removed] || [removed] || [removed] || Can u explain the taxation bit? || I don't know but even if he did, that's him threatening to take his skills elsewhere if he doesn't get the compensation he wants.

Don't we all do that with our employers? || Do you have a source for that? That isn't generally how proxy votes work

They need a majority of Yes votes. || Her logic was we the shareholders were misinformed. We then got that info, already had the performance gains of the stock, and still voted for the pay package. We proved her analysis incorrect, is the point. She's just using her position to hurt Musk, which is something I hope Tesla investors legally go after her for. || So.. what even are the consequences of this? || It does not say that anywhere.  || So wtf is the point of this whole thing? We voted. Twice. Passed. She said fuck us twice. But Tesla will still give him the 56 billion? How's that work || I feel like if what you said were true then CNBC, etc wouldn't be making such a big deal about this. || The judge did not state that anywhere in the ruling. || Or does he just have a track record of getting lucky and being in the right place at the right time? || Choose any competitor's stock and compare it to TSLA in the 1 month, 6 month, YTD, 1-year, 2-year and 5-year charts. 

  
I'm willing to bet that most Ford/Volkswagen/etc. investors wished they had bought Tesla stock instead. || Reading these morons try to understand corporate law is painful. How can they be so easy to manipulate || Her logic was that missing info could have changed the vote. We the shareholders told her she is wrong with a second vote. She's ignoring that she was proven wrong to maintain her ruling, which can only be interpreted as an attack on Musk, or an enrichment of the prosecuting lawyers. Either way she should be investigated. || It was a new pay package though. 
Instead of “here are the hoops” it was “Should we compensate him this amount retroactively.” 

Its an entirely different type of proposal.  || It wasn't nullified for being excessive it was determined that the TSLA independent board was not in fact independent.

Regardless of if shareholders voted on it the pay package is tainted. 

There's no way to know if the board at the time truly negotiated the best deal in the interest of the shareholders.  || That’s not what the judge did though. Guys, can you please READ THE CASE before posting inflammatory comments || What makes things even worse is that this is about retroactive compensation. He did all the things he said he was going to do (which outsiders called crazy) and now he's getting screwed for making people (including many people in DC!) very very rich.  || But then wouldn't the second pay package still stand? And they just have to pay the 345m? || Supermajority can’t overrule rule of law. What if supermajority of Pfizer shareholders voted to illegally sell water as vaccines—should that overrule the law because the supermajority agrees to it? || And that’s why it doesn’t mean much || It is never a service to shareholders to overrule their decision, twice. If shareholders wanted to donate all of their profits to charity, or burn them in a dumpster fire, the only ethical thing is to let them do so. A judge is not supposed to have the say on what benefits them the most, and theoretically a judge could make a decision that results in financial damage to shareholders with no liability for the outcome.

THAT SAID, this is now the legal precedent in Delaware. If you buy shares in a Delaware company, your decisions may always be vetoed by a judge now. Buyer beware. || The shareholders voted in favor of it. Two times actually. The judge overstepped. || How is crashing a company's stock a ""Service"" to shareholders?

You are all now poor, your welcome. || Oh please. Elon started nothing. || Isn't that shit wild? Throwing around numbers that basically don't even exist it's just so fuckin big || *56 || Yep, 0.3% || I won’t say billionaires shouldn’t exist, but nobody should be *paid* in billions. (I know it wasn’t cash) It’s obscene. || Most blatant case of stock manipulation that went unpunished.  || Nice. || I sold 100, 000 shares of Tesla a few weeks after the SEC stepped in about that tweet. 

Biggest regret of my life. || Always about taxes || Pretty much the most simple description. It's what these tesla shareholders aren't getting.

You just can't keep submitting an illegal pay package || But the package wasn't illegal so much as the lack of disclosures around it the original ruling, which I agree with. 

If that's the case, then why would you not be able to make the proper disclosures and revote on it? 

Does this judge think she can define what is an appropriate package, because that would be absolute judicial over reach. 

And I don't like his pay package, but I also don't want judges to determine CEO pay. || The claim was that it was not sufficiently disclosed. There was nothing unlawful about the vote. The board members all abstained from their votes to create a real majority of the minority vote.

This literally cannot stand without destroying delware as a corporate haven. It won't survive deleware review. The Feds will eviserate it. || The shareholder that initiated the lawsuit owns like 10 tesla shares.

There was a re-vote, and the shareholders again voted highly in favor of the pay package. || Shareholder with a grand total of 9 shares, not shareholders. And they get $345mn when they created zero wealth for the stakeholders. This is beyond ridiculous || Precisely what did they misrepresent?

The only tangible argument was that the Board of Directors was not completely impartial and had ties to Elon Musk. This, however, does not invalidate the fact that shareholders voted to award Elon Musk this pay package should Tesla shareholders hit certain ROI targets — TWICE — once in 2018 and again in 2024.

The 2024 results are interesting because while shareholders approved Elon Musk’s pay package, they also scaled up shareholder control by passing proposals that shortened board terms — despite the Board advising them to vote against these proposals.

This shows that the shareholders are aware of the issues with the Board’s ties to Elon Musk, but that doesn’t make them feel differently about whether or not Elon Musk should receive his CEO bonus.

I don’t know what to say but the Board’s ties to Elon Musk is an issue… sure. It becomes less of an issue though when the terms are voted on by the shareholders directly, which happened both times. || They actually can. The standard is disclosure. Only when disclosure fails do we go to a fairness rule. As long as all the conflicted voters are abstained it could happen under a majority of the minority vote. || What law did he break? || She says in her original ruling the case is novel. Thats legal speak for we have never done anything like this before. || Laws are there to protect the shareholders || Who got to place the shareholders? || they didnt disclose the pay package which is the part thats the problem. 

they need to make a new pay package that is disclosed and then vote on it. || What a ridiculous thing to say.

That’s not what’s happening here AT ALL.

You and your friends wouldn’t be able to do that because you don’t actually work at the company. Elon Musk was awarded these shares due to his time as Tesla’s CEO. It’s basically a bonus in stock options.

It’s also performance tied.

Not only do you need to be the CEO, but you need to have achieved specific ROIs for all shareholders to unlock the CEO bonus at the end of the term.

This CEO bonus will also need to be agreed upon beforehand. You can’t arbitrarily decide to hand it out.

This bonus was agreed upon in 2017 and hinged on the performance  of Tesla’s stock between 2018 and 2024.

And really… Elon Musk getting $56 Billion in stock won’t inflate away the value of the company, as that’s about 3-4% of the company’s market cap.

So, yea sure…

1. Get your friends to buy 51% in a public company
2. Appoint yourself as CEO for 6 years
3. Negotiate a bonus payment with all shareholders where you get an extra 5% of the company’s after 6 years if you double everyone’s capital
4. Hope you actually pull through

And for reference, while Tesla stock holders can expect to be diluted by 5% because of Elon Musk’s bonus… they did make 1600% ROI in those 6 years.

So, yea… I guess to some degree there is an argument where Elon Musk has earned this bonus as it’s only a tiny fraction of what investors made. Tesla, after all, is special in that no other company has a CEO that is so central to its mythos. || It’s not a private company. Shareholders matter. The board members have a fiduciary responsibility to protect them from mismanagement…like an excessive pay package. || There is additional oversight for public companies, but the relevant oversight in this case also applies to private companies. If Tesla was private it would still have shareholders and a board of directors with a fiduciary responsibility to those shareholders. If Tesla was private and gave musk this payout then one of its private shareholders could still sue and say the compensation agreement was invalid because the board failed to act appropriately. || he wont. his bio is literally ""If I block you it's because I don't see a point in arguing with people who don't know what they're talking about.""

it's just a 12 year old trolling || Unfortunately chose my job out of passion and not for the salary. || What skill do I upgrade that’s worth $7k per second? || that is completely separate thing: shareholders gets “paid” by owning the shares - no work required. All shareholders benefit when company grows - no need to do any work.  
CEOs doesn’t work for the shares they already have - they can earn money on them even if they don’t work as CEOs. They work for money. Either in dollars or in stock (or options).  
He made one of the most spectacular return on investment ever - turning company that was worth less than $1b into company that is worth more than one trillion. Any shareholder at any company worth less than a billion would pay CEO $56 billion to 1000x their investment into trillion. || Yeah and so does vanguard, yet they aren't running the company are they? || Nobody does anything alone so this is a meaningless differentiation. I couldn’t care less about Musks comp but this is definitely a Reddit take. You can’t even make a Big Mac on your own, so to try to differentiate a CEO that “does it alone” vs “is carried” is hilarious, and is obviously politically motivated by you here. The entire job of the C suite is to manage the workforce, essentially. Obviously they’re not doing anything alone. || well, I don’t think you understand role of CEO.  
It isn’t to work 60+ hours a week and to create amazing things.  
Their work is to arrange things so that company grows and grow fast and profitably. Mostly by being carried by their talented employees.  
Yet, only three or four companies managed to be carried by their employees to one trillion valuation.  
No one pays CEO by hours worked. And no one cares how many hours they work, as long as shareholders make nice money. || It should not be included in his ownership % || The shares still exist in an account if thats what you mean. But its not part of his net worth. || The original package was approved by a biased board, so a shareholder sued on the grounds that the board violated their duty to shareholders. || Because the people on the board of directors who approved the pay package are conflicted and are associates of musk and did not properly insulate themselves from the obvious conflict of interest in approving the largest pay package in the history of the world by a long shot lot, including people like his own brother.

Maybe you should actually read about the case or any of the basic facts before you form an opinion that it’s stupid lol. 

Literally asking why they did it and calling it stupid in the same comment. Talk about stupid. || Because that's exactly what corporate courts are for, to ensure that investors aren't taken advantage of.

You can't have a shareholder vote to overrule the law lol. || When you’re a publicly traded company you have a fiduciary duty to the shareholders, to act in their best interest.  They didn’t do that here. || Because we have laws to protect investors. Why allow a board and ceo to take advantage of investors? || > Why is a court telling companies how to run their business? 

Bro... what? You do know THERE ARE LAWS in this country.... right?? || That was one of the original purpose of the electoral college xD

Ofc in practice it never actually functioned that way. || Even felons can be presidents so not surprised || There is.  The electoral college is that.

It’s just that the smart people aren’t the politicians, like it should be… they’re the people behind them buying politicians out and rigging the system. || That’s exactly why they came up with the electoral college. || Because one party works hard to ensure there are no such laws || I don't know how it is in America, but here in Europe, where the judges are corrupt, you can just get your opponent convicted and that'll be all... It shouldn't be that way, and that's one of the reasons it isn't. 

Mandela was in prison for decades before becoming president. I am not saying this is the same, I am just saying that it is democratic. || Its a feature. Not a bug. || that would be called selling your equity stake in an open and free market . Nobody is being held by gunpoint to hold shares of TSLA || No, the judge stated that you must draw up a restructured pay package because the first one was illegally done. 

Shareholders rights don't supercede the law || If you read the decision it wasn’t just the disclosure of conflicts they had problems with, it was the board’s process for negotiating it.  Resubmitting the package from the old process shows that they didn’t remedy that part. || Elon doesn’t own anywhere close to 50% of Tesla. 

But the pay package passed with 72% support. || it was 90% for the plan. it went to 75% with the entire board and Musk abstaining from the second round. || Whatever metrics you use, the company is worth significantly more than that. Regardless, if you think the company is worth that little then this pay package is also worth way less. His pay package is just a percentage of the company. || Their internal projections prior to the first vote had it at a 60% chance of him hitting all the goals. That does seem pretty unethical and negligent to not share that with shareholders and instead sell it as an impossible task that would never happen when those are pretty decent odds. || Seriously lol Reddit is so dumb. || But then, after all of that became public knowledge, the shareholders voted to reinstate it. They essentially said “we don’t care.” So why does the judge have the ability to dictate against the free will of a public company’s shareholders?

(I do not own TSLA stock or have any positions relating to it.) || What do you mean?

They made capital contributors aware that this package would only get paid out if a *likely* impossible objective was achieved (shoot for the stars champ).  Regardless of the outcome, the shareholders benefited because the company would be miles ahead of where it was.

Internally they’re sending a message to the troops that “although this seems impossible, it’s not.  We can do it if we execute perfectly”.

You can’t achieve anything of value without sending that second message internally.   They HAD to have projections that it was possible, or they’d be criminals to event attempt it

please for the love of god, use your brain and think.   There’s so many other companies that are blatantly corrupt on wall street.  You don’t even have to try to make the argument and you can be the czar of wisdom.

Why steel man a side that has no rationality in being correct?   Is this even your idea, or something that’s slowly been bled into your consciousness from micro interactions with media? || If X is excessive and Y is roughly X less than X, X can be excessive without Y being excessive || “the Tesla board never told shareholders the goals were easier to achieve than the company was acknowledging and that internal projections showed Musk was quickly going to qualify for large portions of the pay package.” || Shouldn’t you have some idea before forming such a strong opinion? || People here will argue that the board had some Super Secret Understanding that they were actually going to meet the growth targets and therefore the agreement was not made in good faith. That, of course, is absurd. Every company has overly-optimistic internal goals and growth targets, and believes they have a plan to meet those targets.

Had the growth not occurred, the same people would be chastising the board for being too optimistic.

Have you ever seen pitch decks from start-ups? The logic applied in this thread would have you believe that investors in start-ups are being duped because the founders of those start-ups are internally ""confident"" in their growth.

The fact that the growth happened is making everyone delusional and blind to how the plan was evaluated by experts at the time of its creation. You could have told every stock analyst and expert in the world at the time that Tesla's board was *100% certain* they would meet the growth targets and nobody would have meaningfully moved their analysis. Because of course the board is optimistic.

And putting all of that aside, *even if* you were convinced that the board was 100% certain they would meet their targets, despite all risks to the contrary, the structure of the plan would mean you would 10X your investment. The gymnastics necessary to paint this as bad for investors is truly remarkable. || You can't project 2 different scenarios publicly and privately || I mean, the Judge with literally 1,000x the information and legal knowledge that you have disagrees, so, I dunno - maybe you’re wrong?

When it is inconvenient, it is bureaucracy? || Amen…. || [removed] || Most people don't have close ties to their employers. Most employers won't breach their duties to the shareholders to grant a ridiculous pay package. A package with metrics they were already on track to make. Most people don't have the ability to tank a company if they don't get that pay package. One that was determined by a court to be flawed and not in the shareholders interest. || No, her logic was original pay package was illegal and voided it. Having a shareholder vote to reinstate does not apply to state law as remedy. Delaware is known for having the best corporate courts as it protects all parties || It doesn't matter if you were informed after the fact, the original pay package was already rescinded by then. You can't override a court ruling with a shareholder vote. They needed to go through the correct process by creating a new plan and following the required procedure.

It's a failure of corporate governance. It exposes just how captive the board is. || Minority shareholders still have rights and a company still has a fiduciary duty to them. If you and a bunch of family/friends all own 51% of a company, you can't just collude to vote to dilute the minority shareholders to enrich yourself. || is there a reason u want to dilute your stock value thats overvalued enough already? You think musk did something to deserve that... || You understand that many of the shareholders now are different from the shareholders then, right? That damage could have been done to people as a result of their lies, and that the solution isn't ""well just get the new guys to agree."" || Her position was that it was illegal. Not just misinformed, but illegal to begin with. 

I mean how isnt it a conflict of interest for that board to even sit on the board? They are supposed to represent shareholders interest, not personal interest and she caught them red handed by saying one thing to investors while saying something else internally. This is, obviously, a conflict of interest and goes against all public company laws. 

What Elon needs to do is remove the public shareholders by taking it private. || The lawyers who sued get $300 million+ off the Tesla shareholders they charged for their ""hard work"".

Elon will have to sell a huge chunk of Tesla shares to cover the additional taxes from the new issue, since the old one isn't being allowed. Further costing shareholders.

This court is a joke for this precedent and it will result in companies leaving who do not want to even the possibility of such a lawsuit coming their way. || What’s the reason you voted to approve this btw? To me it seems silly, he’s gonna take all profits out of Tesla to what? Pay off Twitter debt? || [deleted] || Helping so many successful companies seems to show a common denominator. Once, sure he got lucky. Twice, there could be an argument he was lucky. 3 times I don’t think so || You’re very naive if you really think that. Elon is absolutely not a product of luck- he didn’t just stumble his way into becoming the richest person on earth and being at the helm of multiple multi-hundred billion dollar companies. I’m personally not a huge fan of his anymore based on the direction he’s gone in recent years and how immature he is, but there’s no way you can attribute his success to luck. || Tesla's return the past 5 years can almost entirely be attributed to naïve investors that believe fraudulent claims Musk has made about robotaxis, full self driving, ai, etc. The company's performance has been quite lackluster.

Tesla's annual revenue growth was 3.43% in 2023.  In comparison, Ford's was 4.46%. Tesla isn't even growing faster than their competitors anymore, but investors continue to price them as if they are going to grow 50% YoY for the next decade.

Musk can delay losses by continuing to make bold promises to pump the stock, but eventually their lack of growth will catch up to them.

I've been called an idiot for not buying ZM stock in September 2020, not buying Square(block) in August 2021, not buying TDOC in feb 2021, etc.... hype can drive prices up an enormous amount in the short term, but only actual results can drive long term returns. || It's like they think a company can do whatever it wants as long as shareholders vote for it.

It's going to be unbelievable to people reading about this era in 50 years' time. They are going to be so confused that people were so incredibly stupid right at the era in human civilization when information became more widespread and more easily accessible than ever before. || It’s honestly so maddening and sad at the same time. So many people think they genuinely know the law better than a judge. A judge with *literally* 1,000x the information on the case and 1,000x the legal training. It’s fucking crazy || It must be past your bedtime there kiddo. If a Judge ruled the package was illegal, you can’t overturn that with a vote. Like, holy shit, you can’t actually believe that’s how the law works!? “The court said this was illegal, but we voted that it was legal, so it’s legal!!”  This is one of the funnier threads I’ve seen on Reddit, genuinely || Still an illegal pay package though so go back to the drawing board and try again || Tesla's own internal projections showed that the targets weren't crazy and that they expected to achieve those goals.

None of that changes the fact that they didn't follow the rules during the initial shareholder vote. || 2nd package isnt for a new payment, it was done in the hopes of fixing the first one, and that is not possible. If they want they can probably hold a new vote for a new package || >rule of law

Which law was broken? || This is one of the biggest straw-mans I've seen in a while. || If Tesla shareholders voted to burn $50b that would be legal but paying someone their agreed salary is not?

Imagine if judge decided your pay is excessive because you ocassinally browse reddit in office and orders you to repay all of your earnings for last 7 years. Then your company said, no, they are good worker and earned their salary but judge still forced you to repay it all back? And company could be sued if they gave you the money back because that's not in the shareholder interest? (and that judge would surely rule against the company if they repaid you) || This isn't rule of law lol this is corporate governance this is basically the government sticking it's nose to where it doesn't belong || The original verdict from the judge said tesla and elon needed to renegotiate the pay package because the shareholders weren't informed that the pay package wasn't vetted by an independent party like they claimed it was and that that the internal projections showed different growth rates for which the company shared publicly || They aren't supposed to try and validate an invalid pay package by retroactively holding a vote (under threat of Musk crashing the stock price if he didn't get his way).

I'm simply claiming that $56B is a vast overpayment of services rendered by Musk. As you said, the shareholders should be making money and the reason the judge is striking this down is that it's not good for the shareholders. That $56B can be put to far better use for the company. Giving all that to Musk wouldn't be in service to the shareholders and/or the company. || You're close. The board of directors didn't approve the package, they recommended its approval to shareholders who voted for it.

Just to clarify, the electoral college system was in theory supposed to be that, but it isn’t that in practice in modern times. Its original idea was to be a check on the public for a fear that direct elections would produce bad results, so instead the states would pick electors who would make the decision on the people’s behalf (but not necessarily locked to whatever the popular wishes were). Pretty quickly, the electoral college participants became a rubber stamp mechanism, merely there to cast a predetermined vote, but that wasn’t the original intent for them. || ""smart"" isn't the right word here, though I agree with your sentiment. The US political system is captured by the rich, for sure. But most of those politicians have also put themselves into the position intentionally to be lobbied for self-enrichment.

Her imagination of how Tesla's CEO pay package should be negotiated was proven wrong by the Tesla shareholders. Overwhelmingly. || Her argument is that the CEO/board relationship made the negotiation of the presented pay package to shareholders illegal. Shareholders learned all that info, still voted for it. Even after having the gains. Enough of their relationships was public knowledge in the first place too. We don't need to know if someone goes to someone else's wedding. || There weren't any lies. Not telling us who went to who's wedding is normal. 

Stock price has already gained the value. Technically no financial incentive to vote for it twice. We voted for it the second time to prove the company's current owners want to pay it. || Her saying ""b/c X went to Y's wedding and didn't disclose in the proposal , the proposal is corrupted"" is ridiculous and is dangerous for shareholder rights in general. I *expect* that level of camaraderie from the leadership or businesses. || It was already approved. Most people believe that shareholders should not have the risk of a judge overruling their democratic vote.

Elon also was considering leaving the company if the vote was not approved. Fair considering that he was being denied something that the owners of the company already agreed to pay. His stated reason for needing shares is to maintain sufficient control of the company - which is a large reason it is valued as it is. If Elon left or had insufficient control of the company, it would most likely decrease in value badly, costing shareholders. || First, the pay package is for shares, not cash. 

Second we voted for it because it is based on performance. Tesla's valued more than all other car companies combined today because Musk made it more than a car company. He could have spent his time as Space X, or started another company, but we got him to grow Tesla. He did his end of the deal, he should get the compensation we agreed to pay him. || You know it isn't to pay him all at once? He hit the goals. He gets paid. Simple as that. Tesla stock and Elon changed my life. Went from renting to owning multiple investment properties along with my now primary residence.

Got in super early and kept buying since 2013. So I want the man to be paid. || What you do with your money is your decision, same goes for me and my money, and same for Elon. Silly or not, our opinions on how someone else spends their money is irrelevant.

I also approved it again because I approved it the first time around. It was a long shot back then and he achieved it. The returns from my investment say he's rightfully earned it. More than that, call me sexist but I believe a man should honor his bond. || That is not what that means, lol. || >Meaning they will still give him the pay package,

they can't give him the original 56b package || So they have to pay him some where else? || It means the judge is forcing TSLA to pay 350million dollars to Bernstein Litowitz & Grossmann.

Absolutely hilarious stuff || How was the second one illegal? 
I understand they pursued it to convince the judge, but its still valid on its own, right?  || Right?? It's a fucked up thing, billions of dollars. || That didn't really change anything  || Yeah.....

  
I mean I'm doing fine. But it would have been nice. || It wasn't a new package || Yeah, when your cousin, personal lawyer, and drug dealer are on the board, kinda not independent. || Crooked board members lol || Well when you're trying to get a pay package for more than the company has made in net income since the company was founded... || Yep. It’s mind boggling people are in here defending him. I’m wondering if they are bots.

Obviously the dude tried to move to Texas and run a re-vote to skirt some laws. I wouldn’t be surprised if the “78%” approval vote was gerrymandered to shit somehow.

For whatever reason this judge thinks it’s B.S and I’d bet it is. || Tesla never lost 56000000000 in value. The pay package is a done thing. It was done years ago. || So the board ignored their fiduciary duty.  It seems pretty simple, God forbid the poor guy has to sell a few shares to fund his ambitions.  Plus those shareholders who voted aren't usually your neighbor. || There are also shareholders that vote against things. Those shareholder need protection when the majority was obtained improperly. || People who get scammed also do so voluntarily. || You do realize this whole thing was started by a shareholder suing Tesla and the BoD? It had nothing to do with the additional oversight faced by public companies. That exact same thing can happen with a private company. Tesla being a private company would not have necessarily prevented this situation from occurring. || Dude is riding Elons dick so hard. || if any one of these can make me one trillion, as Elon did, I would definitely pay them $56 billion.  
  
Sometimes even few simple decisions means that resources (those talented people) are spend much much better and thus creates much more value for everyone than if those decisions were different.  
  
So it’s more of an point of view - CEOs doesn’t create value, but they do decide about allocation of huge resources. If they can get 10x value out of same work of same people, or even more - I think they are vital to pushing humanity further.  
  
For example without Tesla success, we could have been burning fossil fuels in cars for decades longer (as established players fought to keep status quo, until Tesla made it impossible) and thus global warming would be much worse. Those talented individuals would probably be working on better combistion engines. World would be far worse off. || It’s not 56B in cash, there’s no “better use” for it. The judge isn’t making a judgement on if it’s too much money, they’re saying the board had certain conflicts of interest. Even if the pay package was 10B, the lawsuit would apply. || First, you said if he did that alone that he would deserve it, but that he doesn’t deserve it because it was all done by employees not CEO. The point is, that’s the job of CEO. To bring in employees so good that company grows immensely. Not to create innovations by themselves.  
it is nice in hindsight to say that these $56 billion could be spent better. But tell any company shareholders that you have an CEO that could make them one trillion dollars and that he is requesting pay of $56 billion to do that. And he only gets paid if he accomplishes that.  
No shareholder in the world would tell you that this would be a waste of their money and they could spend them better.  
After the fact, when shareholders already got their paycheck, yeah, it’s “unreasonable”. || > The court said the link between Musk and the board [...] was not disclosed well enough

It's not just about disclosure. The board has a fiduciary duty to negotiate a fair CEO pay package on behalf of Tesla Investors. The failure to do so is one of the reasons why the initial pay package was struck down. It may have played a factor in the recent ruling too (I have not read the opinion yet).

The problem that all the Tesla fanboys don't understand is that a vote is not a replacement for negotiations. Shareholders were presented with a binary choice which represented two extremes: overpay Elon by an extravagant amount or pay him nothing and risk him leaving the company. Both extremes are horrible for shareholders. These options amounted to a game of chicken. The shareholders could yield and overpay Elon by a large amount. Or they could gamble the fate of the company and their investment hoping that Elon would back down. The boards clearly failed to act as a fiduciary again.

The ability to negotiate breaks the stalemate imposed by the game of chicken with greatly reduced risk. Elon has a large fraction of his personal wealth tied to Tesla. This gives the board leverage. The board can call his bluff in rounds of negotiations with little risk to the company. A competent board, acting as a fiduciary, should be able to negotiate a much better deal for shareholders than either options presented as a vote. || He was convicted in New York, felons can vote if not in jail in New York.
Yes I understand this was sarcasm

Edited charged to convicted cuz I used the wrong word for some reason. || Found the election denier || The decision is right there for you to read. || So by submitting the package again only getting 1 share less, is that considered a new pay package? || Shockingly people inside the company tend to know more about it than those outside. || > outside independent analysts

The board was stacked with non-independent directors. The board was essentially a mouthpiece for Musk, and was publicly saying one thing while privately saying another.

That was the whole basis for the shareholder lawsuit that kicked this off: that minority shareholders have inalienable rights and 51% of the shareholders cannot simply vote to enrich themselves (or a 3rd party) at the expense of the other 49%.

This is not a new thing, and has been a principle since at least 1919 and Ford vs Dodge (ironically another car company) || Maybe try reading an article about it. There must be one around here so- oh yeah, it's the OP! || I repeat a later point: you could have told any analyst or expert in 2018 that the Tesla board was 100% certain they would meet their targets. Doing so would not have meaningfully changed their analysis. The fact that the board saw a path to meeting the goals and were confident in their ability to execute means they were like any other board or company leadership. You could have told the shareholders that meeting the goals was considered a *certainty* by the board and it would not have changed the shareholder vote outcome. How do I know this? Because we all know the outcome now, and the recent re-vote *re-approved* the plan with full knowledge that the goals were already met.

Shareholders would obviously approve the plan, even with full knowledge that the board was 100% certain that it would succeed, because doing so meant the shareholders would *10X their investment*. If you could enter into an investment with that level of pay-out and absolute certainty of success, you would approve such plans every single time.

It's a weird hindsight bias to now say, ""Well, hey, the board was optimistic and predicted this outcome, so I guess that's fraud."" Meanwhile, every other board on the planet has similar optimism and doesn't meet their goals but no one cares because boards are always optimistic. || Nah. This isn’t some appeal to authority issue man. Essentially everyone in this thread has read next to nothing on this case and do not understand it at all, yet are making wide sweeping and definitive claims. I am quite confident that letting these uninformed children (literally, I bet most are like 15 years old) go unchecked wouldn’t expand my horizons in life || [deleted] || ""The owners of the company should be able to pay the CEO whatever they decide. It's their company, it's their money, they can spend or invest or however they want.""

There's no problem with paying ceos. That's totally legal. As long as you go through the right channels and don't break any laws. If you don't want to go through those channels go private and you won't have to deal with it. || Blame him making it a public company. If it was private he can pay himself whatever he wants.  Once you make it public you now follow the laws.  You can't have your cake and eat it too. || You're poor, calm down with the Russian points lmao || I think you’re not understanding that the original package was illegal. Doesn’t matter what Elon or Tesla fanboys think. The vote doesn’t make the package less illegal. || Congrats bro || Man or woman. Honor knows no sex. || [deleted] || Haha, and yet here we are with droves of lemmings trying to defend Tesla's morally bankrupt corporate governance 🤷‍♂️

I know they aren't the brightest, but it's a pretty simple case and a cut and dry outcome. || Voting on the package doesn't make the package not illegally created.

go back and try again with a new proposal || In the board game / contest this is to you, you're correct. || Where it started has nothing to do with where it is now. Which is exactly what this thread is about. What is happening now is entirely based on public company oversight.

Do you think if you say maybe, possibly, could be, and reference scenarios that aren’t the topic at hand that you sound right? You sound lost. || I understand it's not cash, I never claimed it was.

There definitely exists better uses than giving it to the richest man on the planet. For example, use it for compensation for other people. They can use it to hire more engineers, scientists, and designers rather than just juicing the guy at the top. || [deleted] || Convicted* || I wasn't sure what president he was talking about lol || The most famous republican president before trump had actual Alzheimer’s || I read it, It was about board independence and disclosure. 

Tesla has changed chairs and brought in new independent directors since 2018 and the plan was disclosed to cover the issues raised at the hearing. 

This is fuckery. || >you could have told any analyst or expert in 2018 that the Tesla board was 100% certain they would meet their targets. Doing so would not have meaningfully changed their analysis.

That's because **the board lied in their disclosure**. Independent analysts can only make good calls with good information, and the judge ruled that the information kept from the shareholders made the difference. Even in hindsight, the targets look more impressive if the state of the company was fraudulently represented. || ""Musk and Tesla can appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court as soon as McCormick enters a final order, which could come as soon as this week. The appeal could take a year to play out.""

Literally from the Reuters article linked in the post.

Edit: lol the guy who asked for this source just messaged me to go kms || How was it illegal? || She said the board and CEO were too close/friendly to have shareholders vote on the pay package. But later, the shareholders were told all that info, and still voted for it. 

It's ok for CEOs and boards have friendly relations. It happens all the time in business. || Why was it illegal, though? || Thanks! || Since you're going there, how dare you forget the rest of the alphabet soup and the + sign?

Anyway, I can only speak for *myself* and the values *I* was taught and raised with. I am not one that shakes hands and back stabs later. || But how. Like what specifically was illegal about the proposal and how does it differ from the new proposal. Haven't seen anyone explain why. || It was a new proposal. It was the same numbers, but proposed again and with proper disclosures.  || You truly don’t seem to have any idea how the US legal system works or the relevant legal factors in this case. You’re just wrong and screaming personal insults because you don’t have any actual argument to make.

For example, Elon is currently suing OpenAI and it’s board of directors because he thinks they failed in their fiduciary duty. He is able to do that even though OpenAI is a private organization. || The shareholders feel juicing the guy at the top will lead to higher returns than without him, it has nothing to do with Elon being the richest person in the word. 

I’m not an Elon fanboy, nor am I directly invested in Tesla, but I’m inclined to agree with them. If Elon walks away, Tesla stock will drop a lot. The shareholders want to retain him, and they decided they’re happy with paying him 56B || he did? || I think you're missing my point.

Setting aside what the board disclosed, assume they *had* in 2018 disclosed everything that we know now. Because all boards are optimistic and because nobody can actually predict the future, no analysts worth their salt would have been meaningfully moved by the knowledge that the board ""is 100% certain that they will meet these goals.""

We all know that analysts such as those on CNBC laughed at the hilarity of the compensation plan at the time. You can't honestly think they would have mocked it any less had it been accompanied by a statement from the board saying, effectively, ""we can guarantee this outcome."" It would likely have been mocked even more strongly: *what naivety*.

If time travel were possible, you could time travel to 2018 and tell an analyst everything we know today and show them this ruling, along with all accompanying paperwork and unless they actually believed you were a time traveler, they still wouldn't believe you if you said Tesla will meet all of the goals early. Because forward-looking plans in the real world carry risk of failure.

And this is why the particular argument that the judge has made about this compensation plan is merely delaying the inevitable. Either the decision will be appealed and overruled by the Delaware Supreme Court, or the company will create a new compensation plan with all necessary disclosures and it will *again* be approved by a majority of shareholders. Shareholders overwhelmingly approve compensating the CEO with the agreed-upon share print because they made an absolute killing on their TSLA investment, and the right thing to do is stick with the original compensation plan, regardless of whether the original disclosures were all buttoned up. || Tesla board didn't state their full relationship with elon

Tesla board stated the pay package was vetted by an independent party (it wasn't)

Tesla board put out growth projections but lied about how achievable they were publicly. They were projected as a moonshot to the public but internally it was stated the projections were in reach.

This lead to shareholders being lied to by the board and elon || It wasn't a new proposal. 

It was the same proposal. Elon doesn't want to pay the taxes that come with rewriting the new proposal which is why he thinks he can get away with this workaround || That has nothing to do with this post. Quite literally nothing. Here let me try. Yesterday I saw a duck eat some bread. 

You’re a teenager. You’re edgy. I get it. But you’re not talking about the topic at hand. You’re just angry that I insulted you for being an inexperienced 14 year old in a stock subreddit. I’d be angry too if I was 14. || Thanks! || Personal insults, the last refuge of a fool who has lost an argument. || >Thanks!

"Salesforce shares rise after earnings beat on revenue, fourth-quarter guidance","Salesforce shares were up 8% on Tuesday after the company reported its fiscal third-quarter earnings, reporting revenue and fiscal fourth-quarter guidance that exceeded analysts’ expectations.

Here is how the company did compared to what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.41 adjusted vs. $2.44 expected
* **Revenue:** $9.44 billion vs. $9.34 billion expected

The company’s revenue grew 8% year-over-year during the fiscal third quarter, which ended on Oct. 31. Its net income was $1.5 billion in the quarter, up 25% from $1.2 billion a year ago.

Salesforce said that it is expecting fiscal fourth-quarter sales to come in between $9.90 billion to $10.10 billion. Analysts were projecting $10.05 billion in fourth-quarter sales.

The company said that it expects an earnings per share between the range of $2.57 and $2.62 in the fourth-quarter, compared to analysts’ expectations of $2.65.

Salesforce also raised the low end of its revenue guidance for its fiscal 2025 to come between $37.8 billion and $38 billion. That’s up slightly from $37.7 billion to $38 billion previously. The new range puts the mid point for Salesforce’s fiscal 2025 revenue guidance at $37.9 billion, ahead of analysts’ expectations of $37.86 billion.

“We delivered another quarter of exceptional financial performance across revenue, margin, cash flow, and cRPO,” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a statement. “Agentforce, our complete AI system for enterprises built into the Salesforce Platform, is at the heart of a groundbreaking transformation.”

The company in August announced that CFO Amy Weaver would step down from her role as chief financial officer but remain in the position until the company appoints a successor, after which she will become an advisor. That same month, activist investor Starboard Value revealed that it boosted its position in Salesforce by roughly 40% in the second quarter following the firm issuing a letter earlier in the year saying that Salesforce was continuing to move “in the right direction” in regards to improving its profit margin.

Starboard Value released a presentation in October in which it noted that Salesforce “can continue to become more efficient and more profitable.”

Palantir Granted FedRAMP High Baseline Authorization,">Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: PLTR) today announced that it has been granted FedRAMP High Authorization for Palantir Federal Cloud Service (PFCS) and Palantir Federal Cloud Service - Supporting Services (PFCS-SS). These authorizations cover the entirety of Palantir’s product offerings and programs—including AIP, Apollo, Foundry, Gotham, FedStart, and Mission Manager—and therefore enable Palantir to provide any of its product offerings to the U.S. Government at the FedRAMP High baseline.

>FedRAMP is a government-wide program that promotes the adoption of secure cloud services across the federal government by providing a standardized approach to security and risk assessment for cloud technologies and federal agencies. This High authorization builds on Palantir’s previous FedRAMP Moderate and DoD IL5 and IL6 authorizations, and enables the U.S. government to process the most sensitive unclassified workloads in Palantir’s cloud offering.

>“We’re proud to have achieved the FedRAMP High milestone for our full product suite, including our award-winning AI Platform (AIP), which is transforming the speed, scale, and efficiency with which the US Government can operate across civilian, defense, and intelligence agencies. With the addition of the PFCS-SS FedRAMP High offering, Palantir is excited to accelerate our work with other technology partners—big and small, government or commercial—to enable their technology to be securely operated on behalf of USG missions,” said Akash Jain, CTO and President of Palantir USG. “This milestone is an affirmation of our ongoing commitment to upholding the highest security standards and being trusted to handle our government partners’ most sensitive data and workloads, as well as our commitment to enabling the entire American technology base to support critical government needs.”

KO worth it for the dividends?,"So if you had a large chunk of money, and don’t want very much risk, but also want to receive a dividend. Is KO (coca cola) the best choice?

What you do with the dividends kind of depends on you? They are not tax efficient so you should ponder \*why\* would you want KO for the dividends.

You are right in that there is risk in bonds. || It’s not just treasury bills.  Municipal bonds and certain private bonds are also tax free.  I don’t know all the rules that determine whether a private bond is taxed or not, but the exempt bonds are usually things that provide a common good like utilities or railroads. || > zero tax on t-bill interest income??

Not quite. Treasuries are exempt from state and local taxes, assuming those exist where the investor lives (not everywhere does). Treasuries are still subject to [federal taxes](https://public.com/learn/how-are-treasury-bills-taxed).

State and city bonds are roughly the other way around: [generally](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/not-always-tax-free-7-municipal-bond-tax-traps) exempt from federal tax, and may be exempt from state tax too, particularly if the bonds were issued by the investor’s home state. || 1. OP wants fixed income, not capital growth.  With that in mind, bonds are a better investment because of the higher yield, tax-free returns, and negligible risk.
2. That's not how dividends work unless you are putting your money in a ponzi scheme.  Dividends are a portion of earnings paid out to shareholders, not a portion of invested funds.  If that were the case then companies like coke that have paid dividends consistently for decades would have run out of money to pay out a long time ago.  It is entirely possible to invest money in a company and get more than you invested in yearly dividends.  Take apple, for example.  If you invested 1000 dollars into apple in 1984 you'd be receiving 8,333 dollars in dividends every year.
3. No shit you should thinking about total return and not just dividend yield.  The thing is, dividends are part of total return."

Buying puts on Rivian lol || If I was Rivian.  I’d sue. I’m sure there is some law here that musk is trying to bend. || Maybe yes maybe not || Oh no, not Doggy's leaders. || Completely disagree, Musk has shown that he doesn’t want the government to help Tesla when he stated in an interview that he thought EV subsidies from the government were bad. Is that the type of person who will use their political power to screw over a competitor? I don’t think so. He’s much more values driven than people realize.

Edit: To be clear he’s not a nice guy. However, he has proven to follow his values even if it’s bad for him or his companies. || Everyone attacking Elon but just ignoring that the gov was just going to give Rivian 6.6 billion? What a clown show of a sub. || Is this a damn joke…? I’m Pretty sure the DOE doesn’t need to be handing over billions to them or any other automaker just to make a plant. || When you have been around for 15 years, don't turn a profit and lose significantly on each product you sell....

Might not be the best idea. Time to let rivian out to pasture. || Master tape CEO of Goodyear tires could be the tittle. Wasting money while they prep you for hardship in the years ahead. Absolutely a scam department. Jobs  in economic  disadvantaged areas with good salaries paying taxes and buying homes is not part of 2025 projects objective. Expansion of competition for elfon  the same way he did is unfair?  Voter approved so hear we go. || Exactly shat i said about rivian.

i was bullish on Rivian, but with Elon controlling where the money goes. It will go to him way before his competitor.

Like it or not it is what it is. There is nothing we can do that saving ourselves and profit of the situation. || I expect Elon to do this with his actual competition, but rivian is not competition. They are on the verge of bankruptcy and will have collapsed before they can repay that loan or even build the factory the loan is for || Bigger question is what is the price tax payers are gonna pay (consulting fees, yada yada) for doge considering it’s not an official department.

Imho this is another innovative way to pocket the pretty penny || It’s like a parody of itself from day 1.  A ministry of “efficiency” has not just one bloated arsehole running it, but two.  And neither is even remotely qualified.  And both have crooked careers.  And both have massive conflicts of interest.

The obvious joke is they could make it more efficient by having the more ruthless one fire the other. || It's literally a fake job Trump invented to placate Musk and Vivek. || Complete lack of focus.

Pentagon can’t find $1 trillion and here are Elon and Musk ruminating about a tiny $7 billion loan to open a factory in the US.

Kleptocracy right here folks. Pathetic.


You know how conservatives always say “follow the money?” Well - Palantir, Anduril, SpaceX, etc. are all defense/government oriented companies all run by close friends of Musk or Musk himself. || I think it will actually hurt us and cost a bunch of money too! Awesome sauce!! || As far as it concerns so far, It doesn’t use any taxpayers money; all volunteers || That would be true…. If it were a government entity and not just some private entity that can’t do anything expect propose changes to Trumps government. || It’s not even a government entity. It wasn’t created by Congress. It’s basically and advisory group working for free or being paid privately but Elon. Anything they recommend needs to be approved by congress or acted upon by the secretary of the cabinet.

But Elon is basically POTUS in shadow. || 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs. Cancel Rivian's loans. Cancel EV tax credit (which hurt Tesla's competitors more). || Lmaoooo shhhh you’re onto them || Almost like we could have predicted this || I like his faux outrage. 

When Trump imposed the tariffs on washing machines, he ended up creating a bit over 1800 US jobs, which cost around $820k pr job. 

[\(source: page 27 conclusion\)](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFI_WP_201961-1.pdf) || > So it’s political to approve the loan, but not political to cancel it?

I mean, yeah. I like Rivian's cars, but their business is disastrous. Is there any precedent to giving a $6.6B loan to a company losing billions a year that's never made any money? Reverting to the mean is not political.

Bailouts for profitable companies that get into bad weather due to external events aren't (necessarily) political, but this reeks of politics. || Sounds like you are long rivian || > So it’s political to approve the loan, but not political to cancel it? And they aren’t “forking over” the money, it’s a loan.

If Rivian is deserving of a loan, they could get one one on the private market.

Government loans are at below market interest rates, and are effectively a subsidy. US Taxpayers stand to lose a lot of money if Rivian fails to deliver, but see little benefit if Rivian succeeds. || It’s not a “real” department. In accordance with the Constitution, the Congress is the sole authority for establishing government departments and agencies. This is because it requires federal funding and Congress controls the purse strings… for now. || That's because it's a commission, not a department. Only acts of congress can create new departments. GAO and OMB already do similar things, but they start from the premise of ""how can we get the government to accomplish its mission with less funding"" rather than ""Screw the mission, how can I enrich Elon and Vivek"" so they're nonstarters for the important work they want to do. || We’re gonna look back at this time and have lots of things to explain. Or we go full idiocracy and just give up. || It’s not.  || I described it as ""the internet finally taking over real life."" 

Your real life used to be the one you felt while exploring the world around you. Now the fake online world is the new reality. || I don't understand how even a Stocks subreddit can be filled with people so attached to the Democratic party that they oppose pro-business policies and ideas. It's a freaking STOCKS sub for crying out loud. We are all going to make more money if someone can get rid of the ridiculous governmental tax waste and regulatory overreach, whether it's called DOGE or Deeznutz.

How can anyone who understands business and economy, which I hope everyone a Stocks sub would do, be opposed to this? || Maybe get over yourself. That’d be a start || While also getting paid tens of billions …. Hmmm. || He’s an oligarch || Everything I've seen is this isn't even a thing with any actual power. Sure, they can make suggestions, but ultimately it feels like Trump is annoyed with Elon and Vivek and wants to make them feel important || this is cope/apathy that would be better spent resisting || I mean it's literally impossible for it to do what was promised, there's not enough discretionary spending in the US budget to cut $2 trillion in spending.

Not to mention a lot of the government spending that's categorized as ""discretionary"" isn't really discretionary. A ton of Federal agencies, and even the Federal court system fall under the ""discretionary"" spending category. || Bro, none of this matters.

The fact is that DOGE is on Twitter and Elon is running it.

With the millions of followers Elon gets on Twitter + the right wing media circuit (Rogan, Fox, Truth Social, etc.) they can make perception reality.

DOGE doesn’t have to do anything to convince millions of Americans that Trump and DOGE shaved mountains of debt by making the government more efficient.

They could lie two ways to Sunday and people wouldn’t even know.

I don't think thats the free market you think it is || You sound like a real well educated fella || I agree with your argument, but the main criticism is double standard. If it were another politician came out against Rivian, there wouldn’t be nearly as much backlash. || Muh Rivian bags! || Bullish on a company on the verge of bankruptcy that just gave their only real moat away to Volkswagen and allowed Volkswagen to literally copy their cars at a cheaper price point is crazy || Elon doesn't control where any money in government goes. || Elon said they arnt taking on salaries || It’s a Monty Python skit IRL. || The point is it will drain fund to musk and others with no benefit for the Americans. The fact that they aren't salaried does not detract from the point made. || Delusional much? It’s like Trump saying in his last administration he was going to waive his wage as president but got all kinds of deals for him and his children at the expense of our government. Less competition in the EV auto and solar power markets will impact all of us. They will fleece us. What’s ironic is that it’s being run by two immigrants. 😂 || Volunteer my foot. Zero benefit to the 2 hex nuts, you say?? I call bs. There are no free lunches and neither nut is patriot like Mel gibson 😂🤡 || Yes, the pigs tend to volunteer to line up at the trough. || So, you are saying is that there are American people who are willing to work hours and hours with no payments for a questionable department that is technically owned by a billionaire. No wonder they want to kick out the immigrants. People here are dumb enough to work for free. /s || Dont forget sue openai to give Elon more ownership. I wonder when be goes after rklb || And call California “insane” for daring to keep tax credits for small EV makers like Lucid and Rivian - who proudly call California home.

This is much more concerning than something like this unfortunately. I think they won’t have the Supreme Court on their side on this one as it sets a bad precedent, and the ultimate end will be a freeze in adding more spending than what’s there, but it’s still something to think about. || [removed] || Oh I understand the context very well.

I will hold your hand, step by step. || But pumping 6.6 billion is ? || He's not using the government to kill them. He's just ending the subsidies. (And that's what this loan is; the free market would've charged more interest.) || Please invest heavily into rivian. || First off, it’s not a politician, it’s a drug addicted psychopathic crook saying it.  Second, any other person saying something would just be a person saying dumb things.  In this case, it’s a crook who purchased an election on behalf of his crime buddy, and now has unchecked power to act on his insane and illegal delusions. || Yeah but he's tight with Trump, and Trump can end a Senators career if they go against him.

So the question is, will Trump use his power to help Elon, or will Trump gradually start to ignore him? 

My money is on the 2nd. Trump needed Musk for Twitter manipulation and $$$. He can still use the Twitter part but as time goes on there's less and less to be gained from it. Seems intentional Elon was put in basically a non Govt consulting job vs something that matters. Hopefully Trump pushes him out || What a stupid comment. Of couse Elon Musk cares whether tax money goes to Rivian or Tesla and Blue Origin or SpaxeX. He'll make billions. || Don’t be naive. compensation != salary. Many ways to be compensated- like slowing down competitors, throwing away NHSTA investigations, favorable deals in other countries, etc || The Hitchhiker’s Guide and Trump is Zaphod Beeblebrox. || Yes, there are. Young people  with rich family background  who want to have some deeper bonds with Elon Musk or Trump for whatever business 

The entire 8hours of no payment requirement is about filtering these people || That's definitely coming. They're gonna sneak some crap into the NASA budget so the contracting parameters specifically match spacex and no one else. || Source on Trump lowering EV tariffs? || Tesla got the loan during one of the worst bad weather events in the last century. Rivian is getting it while the economy is thriving and there are no external factors negatively affecting their business. Hardly comparable.

Also, a loan is not a handout. || I can see your argument and I wouldn't have been against a loan during the COVID times, but we are long passed that. Any trouble Rivian is going through now is just a result of their poor cost control (like spending 1/3rd as much as Tesla did in 2020 before even selling any cars), not the markets or economy.

Besides, Rivian found plenty of funding on the capital markets. Giving them a government loan now is just messing with capitalism, and I don't see any reason for it other than political ones. If they can't survive after the incredible amounts of funding they got at insanely beneficial valuations, they're not efficient enough to be a company. || Whether or not Rivian should've received that loan has nothing to do with Tesla. There is simply no common sense reason the government would give that loan other than political reasons. || How is any of this making government bigger? It's not an actual department and it's scheduled to be closed within 2 years, after removing a significant chunk of the existing government. || It's definitely about politics. I doubt you'll find more than 25% of people who are (actual) independents that agree with that statement. || Still lost? Are you running out of actual political subs? || Just like we will hold your hand as you run away with them goalposts, lol. || You just completely shifted your “criteria” because you’re just an Elon d rider or a partisan hack. Move along now || To be fair, Rivian is the only EV exclusive company that’s successfully launched a truck that has caught the eye of the traditional truck crowd.  Ford lighting is the only other I can think of, but ford isn’t EV exclusive.

The cyberjunk is an ongoing joke when talking about work trucks. || Congrats on moving the goalposts. I don’t want to touch your hand either.

Tesla also has the Chinese market and Europe. Two that Rivian has not entered yet.

Let’s see those Tesla sales in China once Byd keeps growing  || Already have 😙 || I think the question here is should rivian really received $6.6B..is this a good use of government funding. Or is $3.3B enough to build a factory. These are all questions I’d love to know the answer to as well so happy someone is questioning it. || Trump cannot just ""end"" a Senators careers. A lot of his endorsements end up losing their races because they are often time nutjobs. He can make their life uncomfortable, for sure, by having his cultists send death and bomb threats to his family. || I didn't say he doesn't care. I said he doesn't control anything and $DOGE is nonsense. || Oh so things that all other politicians do? Or when politicians trade stocks in their personal account ahead of laws being announced or info made public (ala Pelosi). All of them do shady things. Stop thinking Elon is doing anything out of the ordinary. || So, there are butt lickers from rich people for richer people. || ah yes an agency run by nepo babies sounds like it will be extremely productive || ""rocket must be reusable"" destroys any competition. || We’re coming back to the 4D chess era remember? || What was the bad weather event in Jan 2010? Didn't realize we loaned out money based on weather. 

Sarcasm aside, the loans are meant to support the transition to Zero Emissions. Tesla got the loan to build a manufacturing facility in Freemont California. Rivian is getting a loan to build a manufacturing facility in Georgia. 

Very comparable. || I’ll tell you what, if you’re right and this doesn’t wind up being a boondoggle, I’ll come back and apologize. 

RemindMe! 5 years || Why do you think it’s called DOGE? ||

This is so embarrassing for you. || The stock is way worse than I thought. Please tell me you are all in since 2021.

If you have questions look into what it is.  || He has full control over a lot of the campaign funding, that's significant sway he has over them. || Obviously I'm not LITERALLY talking about trump firing them. 

BUT, Trumps daughter in law is currently running the RNC (which distributes a lot of funding), Trump got a massive percentage of the R vote in the primaries proving that MAGA is still very strong- Trump endorsing a primary challenger and talking shot about the incumbent absolutely could get the R senator replaced.

Look at the list of Rs who have gone against trump- Romney? Chased out. Liz Cheney? Chased out. To survive in the R party (which is now the MAGA party) you have to go along with Trump. Look at Romney, Pence, Liz Cheney, Nikki Haley- all chased off and have no political future. Look at Trump loyalists- all won reelection and are getting cabinet positions || He definitely can.

Nobody sinks millions of dollars with zero returns in mind. Definitely not elonia 🤦‍♂️ || Hardly comparable. Tesla (and other OEMs) were in the middle of the financial crisis hardship. They were also the first to build EVs at a time where there was hardly any funding on the capital markets for it.

It is likely just investors taking profits before year end. || When you researched the stock, did you somehow miss that it 3x’d in a month? || There's a lesson to be learned somewhere there, I can almost see it... || I learned the lesson you just learned during the weed stocks craze.  Sucks but this is why we use stop losses || Welcome to the world of p&d || A lot of traders been stalking this one for a short.  Myself included. If you believe in the story keep an eye on it || Because people moved on to HOVR.

Im surprised the gambling sub wasent shut down for market manipulation at this point. But I guess some big shots love to have more retails to dump their bags on || Missed the train by a few weeks. || FOMO rarely pays off || Damn, sorry to hear that. These are volatile stocks, I’m used to +/- 5% on no news, but I’ve been puzzled about what prompted back to back +20% days. Must have been the Reddit hype train. || Impulse buying a no name ticker that was getting pumped online. What could go wrong? || You are welcome 🤗 || Learn a lesson from this experience which is to buy a quality ETF instead of gambling on a risky stock. You build wealth slowly over time. Not overnight or in a matter of days/weeks. || Sometimes you need to close your ears and eyes to this subreddit. Not everything needs to be hopped on 😭 || They only have 85k shares to borrow. Which is insanely low. || If only they invented something where you could set the stock to sell at a level that you deemed to be reasonable considering your risk tolerance and expected gain 😔 || Flying cars... what could go wrong? || If you’re holding for the long term then this shouldn’t be a problem. If you were hoping to cash out on quick gains you were gambling and lost || Buy the dip!! || -23%? $LILM says hold my beer! || Buy high, sell low. Looks like you're doing it right! || Of course this is the one stock that a family member told me about over the holiday. 

Their stock picking guru/ penny stock gambler friend made some money on it but of course I didn't hear anything about any entry/exit points. Not that I really care but it's just interesting how new investors latch on to single tickers. And I get to hear about it every single time they bring up investing. || Gap may be filled. Doubt it goes below 6. This thing caught retail attention and WSB jumped on hard. The proper reaction to that is to take their money. I expect to see it return back to eat highs relatively soon but I have been on this for months so it’s easy to say for me.

If you like the company then buy the dip. || Not all stocks are considered to be investments. Some stocks are pure scams/pump and dumps. || Yep; the pump is over when Reddit gets a hold of, especially small caps and meme hype stocks that don’t have any viable business. || It’s a meme stock, what did you expect? || Ive already gained 3x since investing last month and made a stop loss order last night after the news came out that Stellantis CEO was quitting. 



Figured it would be a bloodbath monday morning...



 i was right... bloodbath on market open but not pre market.. . || Just wait till the next pump || Last week I called both ACHR and JOBY as “turds” and I bought them 9 months ago while watching them plunge. Pleasantly surprised by the recent huge gains, but I knew it was a short ride and stopped out with 30% profits. || Why? Why you ask? Do you know what they make? Who are they marketing / selling these drone helicopters to? I ain't bringing one to the gym, grocery store, or work.  || First you haven't lost anything unless you sold. Next it's been pretty transparent news that a possible dilution would occur pending a vote of share holders as to whether or not to issue more stocks so people are likely taking some profit before that happens. Sell covered calls above your purchase while the dust settles and you'll be fine. || I thought I was in the WSB subreddit, dude they are GOING to make planes to transport the Uber rich in urban areas - you wana invest in that?

Oh yeah also zero revenue || It was getting very overextended and people were FOMO'ing into the stock at peak levels so of course, there'd be a sell off at some point.

If the company is good and if/when the big institutions see value, they'll carry the price back up. || You should sue reddit, and also pick a couple of shills below as defendants. Many people got their money back that way. || Sounds like you deserved it.  || Exactly why I use the dreaded indicators that some seem to despise.  || You're welcome. Now put my fries in the bag || You can pretty much stay away from the majority of stocks that are celebrated on Reddit.  Reddit seems to like companies with lots of hype and little revenue. || 😃zd,drd,zz, do, and,rrzrrrrzrzrrzr, and 444*4#4r,rrz,xxxxx,xxx,xxx,x,,4 || You have to get into these stocks early. There a lots of small caps with potential that haven't been swallowed by PE yet.

RDW, ASTS, RKLB, ACHR, JOBY... plus 10 more I've seen around here and countless others.

It's a gamble, it really is. 

The more you have, the more you're willing to 'risk'. || Nows your chance to buy more before it goes back up || Comedy gold || lol I bought ENPH bc people were hyping it on here. It’s been depreciating ever since. I’m never listening to Reddit again || I learned a long time ago that buy high sell low doesn’t get you anywhere. You shoulda bought SMCI on Friday instead, sold it today, then bought ACHR today. || Thanks for the donation.😂 || When I get a Reddit tip, I usually will just buy a call or two to test the waters.  Like you I am losing on the ACHR contracts but I have until 12/27 to see where this stock goes || Cause it was due for a pullback. What kind of question is this? First time? || market correction. i got in at 2.75 and will hold. at an average of 4.75, it should be fine on my end || LOL, it is all pump and dump.  Bubble popped. || Average down opportunity. 😀 || Well shit.. I just bought at $7.. you should have waited for the dip! || DCA if you believe in the company. If you don’t believe in the company then idk what to tell you man. || Archer is a car company. Car companies never a good idea. Iong time back. I bought Ford for $11. Even after 5 years, it stayed the same. Learned my lesson. || Have seen this so many times and got burned so many times as well: RKLB, ASTS, LUNR. All the same. But all of these have at least doubled, and some x5 their value before they were shilled on reddit. This too may have a chance long term, but not without any risks.
I got in with ACHR just a month ago and made some good money on it. Sold almost all except some shares last week after seeing it go crazy. || Newton said many years ago - something that goes up must come down. So it did || Some asshole was on stocktwits today claiming their planes are nothing but CGI.  I’m guessing he was short awhile ago and losing his too.  Still think they’ll rally back by end of year, though. || First, welcome to gambling. 

Second the US markets are notorious for having an elevated pre-market come crashing down in the first 10 minutes of trading.  

Third, ACHR took off and was bound to retreat. It’s why I bought puts Friday expecting the price to relax over a couple weeks. Didn’t think it would happen so fast. Sold my $9 puts this morning.   

Remember, December often sees stock sales for tax related purposes. || Whoever told u to buy at 6 did u a disservice only few points off 52 week high major stock manipulation at archer, I may have to uncover this on my channel || you got pumped then you got dumped || You bought a stock that is up over 300% in a few weeks. WTF did you expect to happen? They always sell off after these types of moves. || Gotta find the support or buy zone for short term entry or average in for longer term

Under 6 looks Ok? || You bought after a week of like 20% gains every day and got surprised by the fact it didn't 6th one in a row. No one to blame but your FOMO, Luckily for you it's probably still got some more room to go up. || You bought into a company that is valued at absorbing 50 percent of the TAM for helicopter sales... but has yet to get an FAA production cert or sell a single bird || What automatically comes to mind when reading your comment is that you are not an investor with knowledge and experience; you buy based on trends and, worst of all, you buy out of euphoria, that is, when stocks are at historic highs. This problem arises when people learn to use tools but lack the technical (professional) criteria to do so. I suggest you learn about technical, fundamental, qualitative, and market analysis so you learn to buy when they're cheap and sell when they're expensive. Furthermore, a 23% drop in Archer is an opportunity to lower your acquisition cost and improve your profit margin in the recovery. || FOMO guy || no one was raving about ACHR besides gamblers on wsb... and if you read about it online, chances are you're late to the party

next time don't FOMO, unless you actually believed in the company long term, in which case, lol flying cars || Sounds like you bought in at a stupid time? I bought previously. Set a stop loss. Made profit. Did you buy a stock that was falling hard?  Sounds like a dumb move on your part op || Hey so let me know what you're planning next so I can inverse it || Lol I found betting the opposite of what people are spamming on here tends to work out the best.  Just use small amounts of capital.  Not 23% of your investment.  I mean, look at all the ETFs and they are only allocating like 2-3% towards any one thing. || 23% so far, i think you mean. At least the bags you're holding are getting lighter! || Uber was not profitable for how long? And they didn't offer a new type of service, people were well familiar with a taxi and very little customer education was needed.

While this requires special infrastructure, people to discover and adopt a new service. If you're poor, it will be too expensive for you. If you're rich, you will want the comfort of your own heli. Now there's some limited number of locations on Earth where this may play out. But the TAM is negligible.

Invest in something more down to Earth. This is just a sexy name for a short term relationship (some speculative trades for a quick profitnif you're lucky to time it). || Just keep holding. It will come back up. || Pump and dump, according to some people. || buy more, you can lower cost basis! || My one regret was that I didn't load up on more puts last week for this electrical helicopter pipe dream. || Firm examination did not do a firm examination of the stock || It’s dropping so then I can buy 60k worth of calls of NVDA || Aren’t you the one who caused that huge drop? If you didn’t buy, it would continue to surge. Stop blaming someone else lmao 😂. || This company is nothing more than SPECULATIVE junk. || ACHR to the MOONNN!!!! || Don't buy a stock that has run up so much, so quickly. || You bought the top after a huge run dude || proud bag holder 😂 here || Taking Profit || ""I'm going to fomo into a stock I know nothing about after it has gained a ludicrous amount in a short period""


""Wow it went down!!!!! Wtf it's reddits fault!!!""


Thank you for your donation, I took profit today  || Still green despite the drop LOLLLL || 😆💯 || RKLB, LUNR and POET also had massive dips today.  Something about non profitable small caps today.  Large caps (like MSFT) did well.

I'm going to watch tomorrow but I may dip my toe in ACHR/LUNR/POET if there is another large dip tomorrow. || look at the chart before investing.  Never go all in at once, especially on something up,  This drop was just filling gaps.  You are fine.  Diversify around other EVTOL stocks,  Joby, SFRM, EVTL, EH || Blame others for your failures, nice investment strategy, sure it will pay off in the long run. You chased the trade, I'm still up on achr quite a bit, didn't even notice the blip today || Almost like eVTOL is a stupid fucking idea and won’t work with existing infrastructure, regulation and current (or near future) battery technology.

https://airinsight.com/the-coming-evtol-collapse/ || Always set the sell limit! || Most traders don’t know this one simple trick!

Unless you want to play in volatility and in general, it’s a horrible idea to buy in the first three hours of trading. If you would have abided like The Dude abides, you would have bought near today’s bottom. 

I bought some calls. Let’s see if she runs again. || \#1 rule for regards, Buy high and sell low,preferably on margin. || Thank you for your exit liquidity. || What part of the company do you believe in? That fairly expensive and sensitive drones were going to suddenly start delivering everything for Amazon? The company sounds like a terrible way to profit real cash. Cool though. You should try thinking about how a company will return value to you as a shareholder and if the business has a way of producing income that makes sense. I don’t feel even remotely bad for you for you buying a stock cuz everyone was “raving” on Reddit about it, without thinking how they’d make money or their financials || Amazing EPS. || Flying taxis aren't real and it's not Dubai. || You FOMO'd into a meme.

Don't do that again! || About time || When you see a chart go parabolic like this one did that is usually not the best time to buy. || So it’s a pre-revenue company that went from $3 to $10 in a month.  There’s bound to be some profit taking.  Is the company worth less or more than $3.68bil five years from now? || Then there’s me. Slowly DCA since 2$ || Make sure to tell us about your next play ahead of time so we can get it before it dumps.  || Buy the dip, not the tip || You haven’t heard the saying “once everyone’s talking about it it’s too late” when it comes to stocks I guess 

You FOMO’d into being a bag holder lol || Someone bought heavy shorts on it in the past 5 days. It’s a battle ground right now. They may cash out. Just sell some covered calls. || Buy when you see something the rest of the market doesn’t, not the opposite way around. || Seems like a pump and dump hype. || Easy come easy go.

Every time I see a stock blow up, I buy a put. Usually it is a small cap meme stock that will pump then dump. I won't if it is a legit company backed by financials such as an sp500 company.


A company that has -300M net income, 20 employees and 50m market cap suddenly goes 10x? Yeah sure that'll hold || After a big run, wait for a profit taking dip.
Never buy into FOMO unless the stock dips. || bro bought a meme stock at ATH and came to Reddit to complain || My humble opinion and advice for OP is to join WSB subreddit , if he is not a member already. He really belongs there. || Buy high sell low || Collapse?  Lol, it's still up over 2x from what it was in late October/early November. || This was a hype pump and dump scheme. || At this point you have to consider that we're all bots working for the stock market to take YOUR money specifically. || I immediately thought of the Reddit reverse indicator..  There was so much chatter about this stock last weekend || Hey OP, there's this ticker going by $PL.  
Don't thank me. || the good old buy high sell low || Take off weight doesnt work out yet || I'd rather get in now than when it's at $15-20. || My guy saw the 3$ stock run to 9$ in two weeks, jumped in at the peak and was shocked that the penny stock with no revenue dumped back down. It’s a long term hold stock on the hopes that they generate revenue in 2026 after their factories open next year.  || Had anyone actually thought through the logistics of having mass numbers of huge drones flying through the sky. What happens when something goes wrong and a small car falls from the sky? What about the noise pollution? I’m not saying it’s impossible for drones to become a reality but I doubt it will be fast or easy. || Dude, you must get in before the ""pump"", not in the middle.  Don't worry, next time you won't make that mistake.  By the way, don't thank us, you did it all by yourself! || *makes an investment decision based on redditors*

HoW cOuLd yOu gUYs dO THiS 2 mE? || OP,  It could always be worse. 

...thinking of the guy who pumped His $1 MM  inheritance from grandma into INTC for it to drop 50% in 2 days and see it's dividend cut by 66%. || Wait the line doesn’t always go up forever? || Yea buying a stock up over 100% in a month is always a great FOMO move. Time to HODL buddy. || On the flip side I did my first ever option . Put £10k in an IBKR account to play with. No , unfortunately i didn’t yolo the whole 10k , I started of slowly with 1 call for January 17th total cost 104 dollars on Tuesday and sold Friday for 440 dollars 

Beginners luck 🍀 || The CEO walked away. How is that anyone on this threads fault || You tell em OP || I read about achr during the weekend and was going to buy it on Monday but didn’t since it is starting to go down after up for days.  So I bought qmco instead. It went down 35% in hours ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|downvote) || Buy low sell high. That is the spartan law. 

If it’s high, there is no glory to be had. Only retreat, surrender, or death.

Spartans never retreat, Spartans never surrender. || A good rule of thumb is that when it comes to anything that is mentioned on Reddit, it's probably a pump and dump. Especially with stocks that are ""under the radar"" or being ""short-squeezed.""  Always do your own due diligence. The posts that show-off ""gains"" are meant to persuade you into investing into stocks so that their gains become bigger. || What collapse? It's up over 30% in under 2 weeks! || OP -is- the exit liquidity || You’re not investing. You’re gambling. Go take a course on investing. || The stock was on the Roaring Kitty sub as a short squeeze. 

If you're not early and smart with these, you'll get rug pulled. Learn from it. || Lmfao! This shit is where it was about 10 days ago. It will be right back up within the next ten. Emotions..tsk tsk tsk.. || Well, at least I was able to see that it was a major cluster fuck of an investment and exited with just 16% loss and didn’t ride the shitstorm to a 30% loss, which is still brutal since I invested more than I was ready to lose in a single coffee break 😂

A few weeks ago I asked for advise where to find good stocks. All answers said read threads on Reddit, so I did..

For you who wondering about my thesis; yes I’d didn’t deep dive into research I’ll admit that. But I read the ER report partially and saw they had half a billion in cash, a lot of good things in the pipeline and really great stock climb recently. That coupled with all the casino Managers in this sub raving about the stock made me pull the trigger. I don’t think the stock value has anything to do with reality, they never are with companies not making money so it’s really pointless to say it’s worth 5 dollar 10 dollar or 1 dollar. As everyone says and knows it’s about growth trajectory, and like I said to me it seemed like they are on a good path. Did I invest thinking I would get rich quick? No. Did I invest thinking it would plummet, certainly no. I just thought it could be a good stock to hold long. I didn’t know it was this volatile. My bad. Lessons learned. || Pump and dump || Lmaoo air travel taxi?!? Maybe good if hold for another 100 years. Stay away from wsb || This one was obvious || Lol you got yourself to blame for chasing. || Friday was the day to sell or pre market today if you had shares. || Looks like a garbage company. Not sure why you're surprised || Your fault for falling for a pump n dump man. || And then blame others (same as sarcastically thanking people). || Someone has to be the bag holder || When there was like all over about “gains” this is easy. Time to gtfo || How has the trading bets sub ended up here? || Que Beauty and the Beast. || The Legend of Bagholder Vance || Fun fact: 5 days ago, op was also complaining about how NVDA ripped him a new one too lmaooo. 


Should follow for more plays to inverse || >less than 5 trading days ago

""You should be grateful for a quick death"" || True. I should’ve bought and held more shares at $3.40 than selling when it hit $4 and buying in this morning on the drop lol. Bought some at $7. Might hold, idk || Good opportunity to create a position or buy more?

edit: typo || Lol exactly. It’s been cooking like a lot of things. We are overdue for a big pullback in the market || The increase in talk and posts about ACHR was my DD that it’s the right time to buy puts! Never saw my initial investment jump 30% in matter of seconds! || leaps are the way, EVTOLs are going to change short haul aviation. I missed the big run up but bought leaps today on the pullback. || I bought some Jan calls today about 80% into the drop.. around $7.25-7.50. talk about catching a falling knife 🤣

I feel pretty good about them though, also picked up a couple thousand shares to play covered calls with. || Same. This is a company that’s worth investing in for the long haul. I jumped in pre $5 and bought more today. I also have leaps for 7/25. || Then you will end up bagholding  || “Thanks for the exit liquidity”-some hedge fund probably || If you weren’t already in it 3-6 months ago, you’re gonna be the bag holder. || Don't invest based on what Reddit is discussing. 

In fact, often it's best to inverse the plethora of uninformed and financially/economically illiterate retail traders that are found online in forums such as these. || Yes I saw it being talked about 30 days ago - was nice run up || So unserious LMAO || Should've side climb || For a bit, but definitely not forever. || Exactly.  Finally, someone who is informed. || That would make sense. STLA’s about $200M deep into Archer: $150M direct investment and $50M of shares bought on the open market. 

(I’m also a STLA investor, and today’s drop stinks but any change has to be good long term. At a PE under 3 just surviving counts as outperformance.) || Do you think this is a good time to open a position in Archer at a discount? || This. I just don't understand people dumping insane amounts of their money into ** checks my notes ** flying cars. || Its totally fine if you got into like sub 5 dollar range. But 10 bucks? I was tempted to buy but held myself off. The do have a full order book though. || Actually the probably works as follows:

If OP jumps in, as he did, then it will definitely too late and the stock will dump. 

However, if OP simply observes to see if it dumps (he knows that it is probably too late after all) then it will continue growing. 

This of course is modeled into a recursive function that ends up with a 100% probability into OP holding bags! || They have $6bil worth of orders rn after they pass the next stage though, so there's definitely interest in what they do! || Also, I'm not selling and actually adding to my position, because its down on zero news.  Buy the dip and hold for the long term. || The rumor is also that they plan to do an offering? Doesn't that also reduce the price? || First new air classification in over 75 years.  It is kind of a big deal || Never go full regard || I had the same exact thought. Like, is this a shit post? Guy has no appetite for risk if can’t handle a down swing and he’s jumping into pre rev companies? Da fuq || Buy high sell low || bag holder club unite 😂 || I also put Stop Loss triggers for RKLB and LUNR || pretty sure it’s just wall street bots which flood the subreddits after it’s ran up lol || Yeah, I was in for 600 shares around the $2.98 price point and have been following their progress for a bit now. I was going to be really excited to see $6-$7 a share in 2025. I sold enough Friday to get my initial money out because the price looked too good to be true and it’s a speculative stock. 

My plan is the same to hold remaining shares for a while. My family asked about buying this weekend and I told them please don’t. My only guess was that shorts may have been keeping it artificially low, but those same shorts being squeezed last week were causing it to be artificially high? But I also have no idea what I’m talking about. || First, yes there is a lot of risk here. But also, if ""you wait untl they have something closer to market"" then you are no longer buying at $5-$7, you will be buying much much higher. I have been buying archer from $3 and will continue to buy archer all through 2025 as long as the price stay sub $12. || I absolutely disagree. Just visited UAE and I grew up in the heart of Silicon Valley and visit LA & NYC often. It will start there and then continue outward. Avoiding congested freeways and travel to oil fields. It’s going to start with the rich and then become more mainstream. Many of the Silicon Valley elite already fly between SFO and SJO…
Ridiculous, but they do it. || LEARNING??? No no no. Blame randos on the internet for your great misfortune and move on to the next thread pumping some BS company.

OP has it. || I mean I was over 100% returns on it until today soooo…. Guess if you know what you’re doing you can money on 0 rev companies…. || I am still hoping for rcat to make me more money. They have a concrete path to increased revenue with their DoD contract. But i did set up a stop loss sell || Roaring Kitty sub?
TIL that exists. || The only thing to make this better now is that it reverses all of its losses and soars again this afternoon || Rklb is a better option for speculative plays, but if you're wanting to sleep well at night, stick to revenue generating companies with at least 50% institutional ownership || Dude. This is not a normal stock. JOBY too. Not normal. They're zero revenue early development speculative growth stocks. Expect insane volatility. 

But I think the speculation don't look bad. Imagine a year from now one of these takes off in your city and lands on top of a building. Imagine the press. The hype. || I bought at 3$.  Holding long || >I didn’t know it was this volatile.

did the 50% in 3 days, or 100% in 5 days not tip you off? || That was my favorite part. ""Why did you guys let me kick myself in the nuts??!""  || It's always easier to blame others, but in this case, people tout, ""Time in the market beats timing the market"" so much that it's a lie. If it wasn't, then we wouldn't insult FOMOers nor care about bag holders. || I might just do that!  Thanks for the tip!  ;) || Jim Cramer doesn't appreciate competition. || Of the market drops everytime you buy, that just means you are an NPC in the simulation. || VTOL is never fuckin happening on a commercial scale, we can barely drive cars. || Said everyone that hyped EVs in 2021 || Why would you buy options on a stock that won't be profitable for decades? you're not betting on the company, you're betting on how the market will act. || Joby is better than Archer in basically every metric. || Warrants work pretty good.  They dropped a bit more than the stock today, but overall they are way further up. || Maybe… but I never gamble more than I can lose. This is a technology advance I believe in. || It's possible. This is a high risk high reward bet and I'm in peace with that. || ""Thanks for the exit liquidity"" - some 24 year old guy who turned his $61 investment into $122 || Me selling my calls to OP on Friday after a 700% gain in 2 weeks  || Never even heard of ACHR until Friday, looked at the chart, opened 10 puts at 9.5 for the 6th, wish I held on longer, sold at -21%.  bad habit of exiting a good trade to early || Basically this. I’d been holding it for several months already. Was happy with the jump last week, doubled up my position on Weds. Held over Thanksgiving and sold Friday AM. Did not want to go into the weekend holding that bag.

I still think it’s a company with a lot of upside though || Thats not true I bought 2 weeks ago at 5 and sold today at 7 made 40 percent || Actually have made the most by getting a pulse on what Reddit is talking about. But these trades are very short term, they usually pump for a few weeks and then pullback significantly. The issue is when you're joining the conversation weeks after the fact and the stock has already peaked or you think any of these are long term investments. || Always remember news follows the stock price || Depends on your time horizon and intention. || Some people have actually done research and followed the progress companies like joby have made instead of going on Reddit and saying misinformed and ignorant comments about emerging industries that have a real opportunity to change the global economy and also heavily reduce car traffic which is literally the worst thing on the planet for an infinite amount of reasons. || I prefer the term “electric helicopters”. That’s basically what they’ll be in the near term: like helicopters but quieter, cheaper to operate^(1), and [arguably](https://spectrum.ieee.org/air-taxis-are-safe-according-to-the-manufacturers-2655317166) safer. Their range is shorter though, so they’re not expected to *replace* choppers anytime soon, instead specializing in areas like shuttle service. 

^(1) Sticker price is about the same for new craft, we’re expecting somewhere in the $1-2M range. Used helicopters are readily available of course, so it’ll be high-end operations that take the plunge first. Expect to see Instagram faux-billionaires posing with “their” eVTOLs within the next couple years. || I put some money into it after reading the ""flying car"" technology can be used for military purposes, which makes sense to me. They also are into making electric planes. || Because when people say ""I read into it"" what they mean is they saw it on reddit and decided to FOMO in lol. || I talked to someone the other day who was telling me how AI will replace doctors in less then 10 years and if you don’t invest in it now than you’re going to be fucked. There are people out there who drink the kool aid and never look back. || Yeah totatlly agree.  I don't think this is a meme stock but I do think everyone got in around the same time due to Reddit etc and some people are taking profits.  I'd like to see where this goes.  I'm invested But I wouldn't put my retirement money into it! || Are you just gonna ignore its up hundreds of percent on no news also? || Anytime someone says rumor they have no idea. The people that decide that in a company would never start a rumor like that. || IRS hate this one simple trick. || Well, I did the same as you: I got out my initial investment when it hit $5 || Maybe, maybe not.

Depends on what “closer to market” means to you and the factors surrounding the company. || Honestly think this bounces back. Not today but back to 9 || JOBY already did a test launch in NYC. I do see these things moving forward. FAA is already working with ACHR on a new category of “aircraft”. I grew up in Palo Alto and know the insanity the freeways look like there now. The Tech bros there will pay for a taxi service to save them 45 minutes. Also UAE, insane money and both companies seem poised to enter market there. Growing new tech and a new market is never without issues. 1980’s and ‘90’s were brutal in Silicon Valley. Gates saved Apple…from bankruptcy. This will happen, just how and who will do it is TBD. || As the old adage goes, if you don’t know who the sucker is at the table… || ""Time in the market beats timing the market"" applies to general investing in the broad sense, not speculative YOLO plays on a Jetsons Taxi Company that's up 100+% in the past month 😄  || It’ll be hot until the first celebrity or sportsball player catches a wind shear and gets splattered on a public street, at which point the hype will go down.

Autonomous or human driven, these are ultra light toy helicopters.  There’s a reason why life insurance isn’t available for people who have helicopters and hang gliders and cliff diving as hobbies. || Honestly, IMO all the value of the VTOL is about their military contracts and commercial use in stuff like surveying and certain types of cargo hauling.

Yes, there is potential, but that ""mass consumer adoption revolution"" propaganda that a lot of companies try to make is kind of a red flag to me. || They'll be autonomous. We already have autonomous swarm drones. || It’s great seeing all the people sag eVTOLs are the future, sounds so familiar to the EV, genomics and Green energy bubble in 2021. Leaps will go to 0 for many people buying them  || leaps are a cheap asymmetrical play. EVs had no way to revolutionize cars the way eVTOLs will. Their only 1:1 competitor is noisy and high maintenance helicopters. || EVTOL has the potential to transform our lives.  EV is just about lowering emissions. EV's compete with established ompanies/  EVOTL has no competition. Not comparable. || To be fair… look at Tesla. || Yes, I'm betting on how the market will act. What do you think you are doing? || But… I’d never go all in on options or bet what I don’t want to or can’t lose. || Some of my best investments were forward thinking. The long game has served me well and I was able to retire before I was 50 because of it. || It's a speculative bet. Sometimes, it's too late to buy the stock by the time the company becomes profitable. || Bought calls in both || Flying cars lol || I agree, this does seem possible. || It was a pump and dump. || Do that 15 more times and he'll be a millionaire || I feel attacked. But I'm 50. || You should’ve sold on Friday and made 80%! /s

My point was just that’s it’s hard to get in & get out of these names that spike so quickly. Congrats on your gains! || Bought a week ago at 4.99, sold at 8.10. || Long term hold, possibly take some profits but maintain a solid position if it pumps again || They still haven't solved the hardest issue: they are incompatible with most modern cities beyond replacing helicopters in their current role. To replace say 20% of cars in NYC with eVtol would require tearing down chunks of the city to build support infrastructure which will never happen. || 
have you heard of trains || LIke a drone that can lift a couple of people and set them down in the city.  Sounds like a trillion dollar idea! || What's the TAM on helicopters? What's the market cap of helicopter companies and how many do they sell?

Helicopters just doesn't seem like a big market. || Of course, this is a casino sir. || It’s up on no news? They are getting further in the FAA very process and are nearing completion of their facility. They also have a backlog of orders. || I guess, let me ask you, what do you mean by closer to market. || EV had to take time to build an entire infrastructure from the base up- eVTOL doesn’t. || > Their only 1:1 competitor is noisy and high maintenance helicopters


And eVTOLs aren't noisy and high maintenance? 


Half the maintenance requirements are because of strict safety standards, and half the noise is the rotors.


EVTOLs have a shopping list of issues that make them unsuitable for 90% of applications in the foreseeable future. Basically the only one they do have is a smaller landing area requirement. || And safety… the elite rich Silicon Valley bros want safety. || If this tech isn’t on the market in 6 months, your leaps will go to 0 || ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm) || To be actually fair... Look at every pure ev play. All are pennies on the dollar vs their ipo except Tesla.


Nice cherry picking BTW.  || I mean they're the only ones profitable. And even they almost went bankrupt. || Betting on the actual return to shareholders the company will produce- the discounted value of future cash flows.

I do not buy a stock unless I believe that if I held it for 30 yeas, it would produce a return higher than the market. || It’s called investing || I get that this is your opinion. It was pretty clear from your earlier comment. || Yeah I made a reckless swing trade on Rcat last week and made 25%. If I had bought an hour later and sold an hour later than I did I would’ve made 40%. If you’re gonna gamble on volatile stocks you need to adopt the mindset that any profit is a big win. || You are correct I did ask myself on Friday if I should sell and I was like naww can't go down thay fast can it. The answer is YES || It's a niche product that hits a niche audience, whoever thinks it's the new Tesla needs their heads evaluated.


The whole value proposition is the first viable option to market, which is still why I'm letting Reddit come and go with this stock. Still well ahead & will be once paper hands move to the new wsb focus point || I will argue the 'which will never happen'. Our current car-centric infrastructure is ridiculously unsustainable in so many ways, economically, socially, environmentally etc. We will have to do a complete overhaul of our infrastructure or everything is going to shit which is also a possibility. 
Anything that replaces cars even a tiny bit needs to be the future because cars are killing more people than war and polluting the environment more than fracking.  || They still haven't gotten around to making them quieter.  Everyone has seen a small drone.  Now, scale that up to plane size and think of all the noise. || Tell that to the American government let alone California where these companies are based. Trains are better I agree but when America spends trillions of dollars and dozens of years on trains that aren't that fucking complicated to build, I 1000% have faith that these companies will go farther than trains ever will in the inept country of America. And just for the meme, market hype and flying cars make money go brr 🤑  || Well does what sounds like normal business development justify a 200% rise on 0 revenue and a very generous market cap? || I dont have a strong definition you can apply because its a mix of many things that give and take confidence in the company’s ability to establish, sustain itself and deliver value

I would look at say OKLO and call it far away

ACHR is closer to the market

ASTS is even closer || Lmao. Vertiports… || I’m hoping you could help me out regarding the sources for those issues, since you know where to look for the data already. Could you provide them? Thank you! || Most of the maintenance for a helicopter goes into the insanely high tolerance jet turbine.. and the other half of a helicopter's noise also comes from that giant turbine ya goofball. 


I don't care if you invest in eVTOLs, we'll see if these leaps print 🤷‍♂️ || Rip Kobe :( || I know this is r/stocks but this level of ignorance is unacceptable  || Leaps by defnition are options that expire more than an year from current date.

And I believe their factory in Georgia is expected to start manufacturing this month or Q1 2025. || And old school I feel the flying taxi companies will be like Tesla 

OR

Betamax vs VHS… someone is going to gain market share and take the market. || Grew up in Palo Alto… Tesla was the only one on my radar. || So did Apple. 1997 gates saved them. || Ok that's one way to do it || This…exactly! || It's called buying a stock now so you can sell it for more later || Atleast sell and buy back in then man. But you do you i guess it’s a good lesson for you to learn  || Sure, but generally you do that by making cities more dense and relying more on public transit, not by making them less dense and adding more low-capacity transit. When comparing autonomous electric rotary-wing transit to autonomous electric car travel, rotary-wing transit is historically significantly more dangerous than car travel, so it would follow this would hold with autonomous vehicles. Same with pollution of rotary-wing vs car.

It really doesn't make any sense as far as I can tell to replace anything besides current helicopter use cases with eVTOL || This isn't true, Joby boasts being silent and as someone who lives where Joby tests I can confirm they are quiet, but hey do your own research right? That means do no research and go to reddit and say some misinformed comment lol || Well considering that asts actually has satellites in space then yes they are closer, but again the asts stock price/market cap reflects that they are actually closer to full commercialization of their product, so if achr was at a similar point in terms of being closer to market then their market cap would be similar, and that would mean a stock price 3x the current levels. || I was being a little facetious while trying to make a point. It's also largely just built up from having a personal intrest over a period of time, rather than any solid data to point to.


The problem with eVTOLs in the current incarnation is that they are assumed to be incredibly widespread compared to similar aircraft, used for regular short distance commuting. 


While they are likely less mechanically complex than aircraft like Helicopters, any sort of failure is going to result in more damage, and less predictable damage, than a ground-based vehicle. Add in the fact that they are expected to be somewhat ubiquitous in their operations areas, it's a lot more rolls of the ""will it failed this time"" dice. The only way you can even hope to get around that is maintaining a strict safety inspection schedule like with a traditional aircraft.


As to noise, the other commenter is correct in that half the noise comes from the engines, but rotors also generate a huge portion of it too as they constantly beat the air. Replacing the mechanical engine with an electric motor will cut it down substantially, but to make something that's tolerably quiet you're going to have to look into more esoteric stuff: things like toroidal propellers or other shapes, or tuning each individual motor to spin at different speeds and then creating bespoke propellers for each one.
___
Other issues include things like:


* traffic; just because its in the air doesn't mean there won't be congestion, especially if you want flying taxis


* traffic *management*; now you've got all those flying cars, how are you going to stop them flying into each other or constantly having to take evasive maneuvers. Saying ""AI"" or ""machine learning"" just isn't going to cut it. There are also a whole list of other issues that can go here alone. You also have to consider things like where they can fly Over residential areas? Close to restricted airspace? What is the minimum safe distance between other aircraft?...


* Safety: do you trust the average person to safely operate a vehicle 100% of the time? Now put them in control of one with more complicated controls and the potential to cause more damage. People are also just stupid. Even taking the controls away and simply putting humans inside a flying box has the potential for something to go wrong.


* Security: a flying car with controls might as well be selling a kamikaze missile to the public. The risk of accidental disasters is bad, imagine people intentionally causing them.


* Ground infrastructure: what goes up must come down, and it must come down somewhere suitable for a safe landing. If you want useful transport that means massively expanding ground infrastructure. Even single point to point is going to need something to deal with all that congestion.


___


The best use-cases I can see right now are things like emergency services, where a small aircraft that can legally commandeer usable landing sites, or reach locations inaccessible via traditional methods (like firefighting in a skyscraper), would be useful. Otherwise, it's more of a novelty or for someone with the wealth and space to set up a dedicated landing site or two. || 👍 let me know how it goes || i don’t wanna stop you but I c got burned buying a leaps on ICLN, and thinking about it for genomics, it just also made so much sense. Unfortunately once the hype cycle is over, it’s back to fundamentals and these companies simply don’t generate any cash flow or don’t have actual products on the market. Leaps go to 0, eVTOL no diff || Cities, counties, states, etc.. Won't allow flying taxis. This is all fantasy.  || Lucid? Rivian? Nikola? Workhorse?  || Do you have a link to a video of one without background music that demonstrates it being quiet? || Hopefully yep || Do you live in Silicon Valley, NYC or Dubai? They absolutely will and do allow helicopter “taxi’s” already. 

The barrier of entry for piloting one safely looks to be leaps and bounds easier and safer than a helicopter. More on the scale of a private airplane. Quieter, faster, greener and safer than a helicopter. It allows transport to areas only accessible to helicopters now. 

Taxi isn’t thier only application. Military, oil field transport, medical transport , frozen area transport aka Alaska, Canada etc. 

My FIL owned a small private plane and would fly to visit us every weekend for breakfast instead of driving 1 hour. 

My dad is a retired rocket scientist who worked at NASA and then in Silicon Valley his entire career. I spent the weekend with him and we discussed the issues to adoption and the engineering challenges for the major and minor players. He had some great insights. 

And back to EV’s… California’s #1 selling car is a Tesla. Our infrastructure is there and it’s not just teslas you see on the road it’s more and more EV’s. 

So while I’m not saying this will be adopted completely like the jetson’s promised us… I believe they will be another transportation option in the near future. 3-10 years. || I have a friend who works at Rivian… it has some real promise. He worked at Tesla before. The company culture there is incredible and the design has incredible promise. I think next year they come out with a cheaper one. 

Personally I just bought an ev Chevy bolt used with rebate and for cash. If it lasts me 2 years it pencils out the same as my gas bill in CA after home charging. If it lasts me 5 year it will cost me 1/3 of what I would have paid for gas and oil changes. 90% of my friends have at least one hybrid or electric car. California has always been on the cutting edge of technology and is creeping up on the 4th largest economy in the world. We are currently 5th.

I have seen some pretty incredible technology advances up close by growing up in Palo Alto. The computer history museum is a who’s who of my dad’s company he worked for and all of the friend’s parents companies. 

Arpanet-to Internet. The silicon chip was invented 6 blocks from my childhood home, pocket computers (aka phones) with more memory than the Apple II I had on my desk growing up. I have seen incredible advances in my life time and I expect to see more. I believe this will be one of the advance. || Silicon valley, maybe. Dubai, yes. NYC and other large cities like Chicago, Seattle, or large Chinese cities won't. Just not gonna happen. They are going to have to sell it to the government aka military.


Amazon is having issues getting their drones to land packages in your backyard not because of the tech, because the government is not allowing it. That's diapers in unmanned drones. Now multiple the size by 50x and putting a person in it. Ain't happening.  || what insights did your dad have? || Cool story bro about Palo Alto. I grew up and worked in the Washington State version up until 2 years ago in Redmond.


Idk why you just gave me your life story in 5 paragraphs. All I was pointing out is all of these stocks are down massively and how much of a bubble they were in. There is other non-USA versions as well down massively, Nio for example.  || Here are a few areas he think these will be adopted more quickly. The lower skill entry for flying than a helicopter, cheaper entry to purchase, cheaper costs to operate. 

He worked with military technology and thinks there is huge potential for them in that setting. The military has been bouncing the idea around for years, but technology and battery storage is finally catching up to the dreams of this type of air vehicle. The quiet factor can also be a huge bonus in war zones. 

Big cities take off and landing, rooftop to rooftop transport or rooftop to airports could be a big market for private sector “taxis” and medical responses. There is already an infrastructure in many large cities for helicopters for this purpose. These are faster (minutes can save lives) appear to be safer and are more cost effective to run and maintain.

Inaccessible areas without roadways or lack of airports or gas support. Vertical take off and landings and battery recharging capabilities is a huge bonus for these types of settings. Oil derricks in desserts, off shore and far away spaces etc. think Alaska, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Texas.

Disaster support. When roadways etc are destroyed these can be a safer, quicker snd cheaper way to get into an area for food, water and emergency medical support. Example of the recent hurricane events in North Carolina. Many private helicopters were the first responders throughout that region. Since these are faster and more manageable, more can be accomplished in a shorter amount of time. Depending on flight time between charges. Again…speed can save lives. 

Rural medial care. There are many care desserts around the USA that do not have quickly accessible hospitals. Hour or more drive times could be cut to 10 minutes. These could be used as “ambulances” in these areas. Again…
Time saves lives. Think Doctors Without Borders…worldwide. 

Flying “cars” or “taxis” for the rich elite who want to save time during commute. || Yep bubbles correct, that doesn’t mean the technology is worthless and won’t amount to anything. 

Many of my best investments have ridden with me through bubbles. I’m fairly good at the long game and I retired years before I hit 50. Time in the market is always greater than timing the market."

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger retires,"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/02/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-retires/

Intel has announced that CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired, effective December 1, and stepped down from the company’s board of directors.
David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus have been named interim co-CEOs. Zinsner is executive vice president and chief financial officer, and Holthaus has been appointed to the newly created position of CEO of Intel Products, a group that spans the company’s client computing group, data center and AI group, network and edge group.

The biggest argument was he was an engineer rather than bean counter.

Intel stock halves under his tenure.

Then Intel stock climbs 5%+ after he leaves. || If I was still holding INTC I would sell the news and take the 4% pop. The CEO retiring just before the release of 18A is a very bad sign IMO. 18A was supposed to be Intel's return to being competitive; Gelsinger stepping aside before that point tells me that 18A may be underperforming or a total flop. || All that startet with Apple Designing their own Arm SOCs because Intel was and is hot garbage and not good for Notebooks and mobile devices 

Intel had enough time since the warning from Apple. Deserved where they are now || Now there’s a chance the dip won’t dip anymore. || Nana loves this news, finally Intel will have a 20%+ day! || ""retires""

The fact that it happened before it was announced means in practice he got pushed out. Anything else is just pretty words. Intel board ran out of patience. || Pat hasn’t done the greatest job, but not the worst either. Intel was arguably fatally wounded before Pat got the job which was an impossible task for anyone. It’s like Nokia… it doesn’t matter who leads the ship, the death spiral was set in motion by idiots before Pat who chose not to invest in GPU development, turned down the request to make mobile chips for Apple and clung onto x86 rather than innovate. || Dude destroyed bagholders, laid off thousands of workers, and put the company even more behind of the competition and was like peace I am out lol. || 13th and 14th gen intel chips ( their top of the line) are having issues where the chip requests too much voltage. Fries itself. Starts crashing machines with blue screens of death. 

Intel first ignored , then lied about it. 

These chips are still being sold. I bought one 2 weeks ago. 

They released bios updates supposedly fixing it. 

Problem is , most don’t realize you need to flash your bios for the fix. Doing that is not normally required when you build a pc. Also does not stop it from crashing if the damage is already done. 

Tried to RMA through intel. They wanted me to jump through a bunch of hoops. For a chip we both know is a LEMON. 

Ended up returning to Newegg. At least they understand intel put out bum chips. 

Always been an intel fanboy. Not anymore. This hassle and subsequent lack of intel making it right have made me switch to AMD || This guy destroyed VMware and Intel, and retires with an insane amount of money. What a life. || Back to the bean counters || It says something the stock spiked up 5.8% on the news. || Nvidia should just buy intel at this point. 3.4T company vs 100B company || Yikes.  I can't help but think he was pushed out OR decided to sponge bob ""welp I'm gonna head out"".  Can't be enjoyable to have lawyers and wallstreet screaming outside your door every second of your existence on the job. With as big of a [Bureaucracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy) that intel has become it has to be a monumentus task to attempt to even get something changed.  At this point intel is a machine inside a machine.  No new hire is going to understand the entire history of intel and how everything works.  Intel is gonna Die. || That ship can't turn. Too late. || Good riddance. Doesn’t solve their massive problems though || People have given up on this company. Not good. || Intel clearly has a culture problem that needs to be addressed on top of the technical issues. || I watched a documentary several days ago describing how he planned to save Intel by beating tsmc || What a mess this company is in, and all while getting government money.
Where the F*** are all the brilliant minds in this company.
This company needs some serious intervention. || I just used the opportunity to part with a third of my INT stock. || So we now have two finance majors running a company, that has been in the gutter stock wise for 20 years. Yea, AMD calls and Intel Puts out the wasoo || So that's why the stock is up today. || I bailed when the board took a look at their dismal trajectory on tech and said “let’s hire an accountant to fix that!”

The fact they were losing business left and right helped, as well as the chorus of people saying “oh don’t worry about this failure, don’t worry about that failure, just remember how big intel is and was”. || They should make the guy who invested his grandmas money in Intel the CEO. He's at least one of the few people in the world who believe in Intel || They're going back to the 14++++++++++++++++nm node. || He was suppose to be the chosen one, yet he just too the money and bounced. /s

  
Imo it appears Intel being purchased by Qualcomm is getting increasingly likely. || Nana would be proud || Good thing Intel got $8 billion of taxpayer money. Just let Intel die or let them get bought out. Stop pouring money into this mismanaged company. || Just a rumor, but I heard they are going to appoint Barron Trump as the CEO. Stock should pop 500% on the announcement. Also, Hulk Hogan is being named as CMO. || Wow, it is effective today. || ""Retires"" - He was always supposed to stay through the fab businss starting up and save the company.  Guess his work is finished and the company is saved? || About 10 years too late. || Quick reminder that their stock shot up around 10% after they announced him as CEO. Now stock is down +50% and shoots +5% after he retires.

I feel  sundar or satya coming in for next ceo. || Does anyone think Intel's foundry pivot will work out? || I wonder if the government had a say in this.   The funding (7.8 billion) just came days ago. || Good about time || That’s what happens when you appoint a nutjob fundamentalist. || Pushed out is more like it. BOD was frustrated and the Chips Act money was glacial pace in coming.  I heard he lost them 15.2B || I think that Pat was brought in to clean up the mess of his predecessors.

He took the stock price from $60 down to $25. That took a lot of work. Gotta give credit where credit is due! || [Fixed it](https://i.redd.it/8g2g3r49rg4e1.png) || Religious wackos make terrible leaders. Now he can spend his days tweeting Bible crap || Like most CEOs || It was god’s plan. || He should be judged by whether or not 18a succeeds and not the stock price under his tenure. Also he legally prevented Intel from splitting from its foundries so it's really ride or die time || But it will depend on his successor, who knows if they gonna dive even more || Nuance may be required. 4 years ago intels biggest issue was the fact that it lost technology leadership. Pat helped them make a lot of progress on their tech roadmap. 

But now they have 18A about to debut and still no customers. Now they need someone who can sell their foundry capacity. They need more focus on their designs now too, as those have had issues. 

Pat made mistakes in expanding capacity more aggressively than he could match with customers. He had some bad product launches. 

If Intel 18A is ultimately successful then Pat’s tenure was possibly “successful” in some really important respects setting them up for future success. It could also be that he had a near impossible task by the time he took over. || Time will tell if he did a good job or not. A company that size with that much R&D will often have a lag of years from when investment in r&d or facilities for r&d was made, and the expected payout. 

I'm not following this stock closely but I understand it's trading near book value.. Which, when you look at how close to WW3 we are, seems fucking stupid considering the monumental demand for Intel production that will create, but what do I know

Again I don't follow this company closely but it's frequently the case that someone with amazing engineering insight comes into a role like this, cleans house and sows the seeds of success, then the person that takes over for them ends up taking all the credit for the ""harvest"" || Only an engineer can get them out of the mess they are in a business person certainly can’t get them out of it. Business people put them in this place in the first place.

Intel has a technology issue not an issue with how to save money. || >He was heralded as Intel's savior 4 years ago by ~~reddit~~ the market

FTFY

Upon the announcement that he would join as the CEO, INTC share prices skyrocketed. The general sentiment around him being chosen was that he would turn around the company. It wasn't just crackpots on Reddit. || I thought he was good at VMware. Bought Intel the day he became CEO, then sold it the next day because I realised it was Intel. || >Intel stock halves under his tenure.

He was appointed at the peak of COVID tech hype, a number of stocks in the industry are half of what they were then. Intel hasn't done stellar, but you're not playing fair here. || >He was heralded as Intel's savior 4 years ago by reddit. The biggest argument was he was an engineer rather than bean counter.

Most importantly, he sent thoughts and prayers. || It is pretty normal for people to be optimistic about new leadership.  It is pretty difficult to tell how things will turn out. || Then tanks 10% when people digest the fact that he wasn't the problem, and that intel's just a dead company. || Dad don't forget to grab the milk on the way home. || You couldn’t say one bad thing about this guy 1 month ago without getting downvoted into oblivion. || I fucked up today, have some options that expire at the end of the month and I should have sold that shit in the middle of the day today. || [deleted] || He ""retired.""  Pretty clear he was fired, doesn't necessarily mean the 18a is performing poorly, just that gelsinger did || Remindme! 2 years || They just got a big influx of cash from the government though. || Not quite. It had little to do with Intel's own chips. 

The issue there was Intel refusing to collaborate on design and manufacturing of the iPhone CPU. They didn't think the iPhone would do enough sales to warrant the work on Intel's side. 


Tsmc took the deal and learned how to collaborate with chip design firms. Now Intel is playing cach up. || Know exactly what you meant with this comment, had a little chuckle || Very few people understand above || This is why. Everyone's trying to same pats fault/not his fault - it didn't matter who they brought in. || He didn’t say peace, the Board gave him a choice, retire or be fired || Yeah, I’m surprised this problem did not get more press attention tbh. Awful response from Intel, they’re cooked. || Honest question, what made you be a fanboy, rather than chosing by performance when it comes to a CPU and pushing the industry forward? || Just happened to me too so frustrating. Now I have to wait 3 weeks without a pc. || It is interesting what happened to VMware post gelsinger.  Broadcom won’t be able to buy the scraps of intel like it did with VMware. || He signed on at Intel with a $115Mil bonus, he never lose anything || Broadcom cleaned out the VMware house and are completely changing direction/rebuilding their roadmap.  Gelsinger did a bad job managing resources (both people and assets) and defining a direction that would lead to growth.

&nbsp;

Intel seems to have been passed by  everyone and even an average CEO would have a very hard time making such a stodgy business a market leader or even competitive. No reason to invest in Intel when there are so many other more promising businesses.

People that bet on the last place horse usually don't do that well. || Then it dropped massively || It says nothing, the stock dropped 10% after. || They weren't allowed to buy Arm, they're not gonna get Intel || It would ruin NVDA’s financials || No need, Nvidia is cooking and will launch a CPU business next year || QCOM should take it || Apple should buy them lol

Or Microsoft || That dude's thesis was beyond dumb. Hoping that China would wreck Taiwan just to pump his Intel bags, as if the global market would not take a massive collective shit if World War III happens. 

At least he didn't forget that he liked the stock! || Your last sentence is ridiculous. Intel is not being purchased by Qualcomm or by anyone else! || They did? As of my knowledge they didn't qualify because the government was smart enough to make the condition that fabs shouldn't be just empty shells i.e. operational. Well, intel didn't deliver, so the $8B won't follow either. || Sounds about right || Yesterday actually? || No board forced him out, and funny enough the Chair of the board is a finance guy so no wonder || Stock went back down after || Onshore fabrication has yet to work so they have a steep hill to climb || He was pushed out || It takes 4-5 years for products to be developed in this industry. || It really isn't his fault tho, he had to fix huge systems and technical problems that have been at Intel for more than a decade now. Can't blame that on him. It's like blaming the 2008 financial crisis on Obama, who was in office for barely a few months at that time. Those sort of colossal problems can't be fixed on such small time scales. I do think that he has tried his best to orient the company on the right path, tho. || You and I could have done better. And we’d get the golden parachute too || Hey - he created a buying opportunity ;) || *tips fedora* || You are absolutely right. Blaming him for the stock price is like blaming the president for a shit economy due to Covid. Shortsighted af. || yea, INTC the stock was gonna be hurt because of the historical cyclical downturn on the horizon and the weight of all the poor decisions before him. But there were debacles in his tenure, as well, don't forget. || >But now they have 18A about to debut and still no customers. 

what makes you say that? if nobody else they at least have the DOD. but likely do have others || Didn’t AWS commit to them? || The fact he got the boot now suggests there may be serious problems with the 18A plan. || This comment makes me want to invest in intel lol || Intel has a leadership and management issue. For extra clarity an engineer (BK) is the reason they're in this place, having an engineer at the helm isn't even close to enough for Intel to be successful. || A business person can pull them out too but they would need to be clever enough to listen to several engineers and assist them in working out a working route.


Be the person who knows a talent and appreciate a talent. Use their strength and help with their weaknesses. 

Basically, you dont need to be an engineer or business person. You need to be a great leader who knows how to listen and how to pick between ideas of talents || Use punctuation, guy. || Intel stock 5Y: -55%

|-|-|-|-| || Apple refused to use Intel Atom processors for the iPhone because of power consumption and overall shitty Performance and specs 

But also Transition to Arm for Laptops and Desktops was decades in planing because too hot running Intel garbage chips 

https://appleinsider.com/articles/12/11/06/arm-based-macs-seen-as-inevitable-but-apple-unlikely-to-switch-anytime-soon || As they should. This man put the company in the toilet. || Past experience. Never had a reason to switch before. One of those “ always did it this way “ things. || Tell me about it. Have an AMD 870 motherboard and a 9750x3d chip on the way. Never used AMD before but this has made me switch. || Wait this is still an issue? When their stock is failing you'd think it would be crisis mode to keep the fanboys and heavy users happy... || ARM and INTEL do different things || Definitely wouldn't, issue 120b in equity which is 4% and buy Intel and pay off their debts. || I double checked and as far as I can tell they're still getting about $8 billion, which was cut from ~$8.5 billion. 

Intel is so poorly mismanaged they decided *against* using EUV machines from ASML. Ask yourself, how stupid do you have to be to make a decision like that?

https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1buc2ww/intel_discloses_7_billion_operating_loss_for/ || Oh snap. || Dang. For some dumb reason I really want to invest in INTC and just want an excuse. I wanted to since the August disaster. I feel like they are going to struggle but they are still a dominant player with x86 processors, and they should move past the recent problems with their processors. That should help them stay afloat even with ARM rising. 

If they can actually pivot to the foundry business this could be a big turnaround. Can this thing actually go any lower? It's up 25% since their disastrous Q2 earnings report... Just something I'd gamble with until their next er in January. || He was pushed out by a board made up of idiots, the Chair of the board is the fmr head of M&A at Citi and watched Citi get demolished by JP B of A and Goldman, problem with having a board led by finance idiots || And he didn't even stick around for one.

They need to go back to leadership that understands R&D

These guys did: 

* (1975-1987) Gordon Moore [Caltech Chemistry PhD]
* (1987-1997) Andy Grove [Berkeley Chemical Engineering PhD] 
* (1997-2005) Craig Barrett [Stanford Materials Science PhD]

These guys didn't:

*  (2005-2013) Paul Otellini [Just a MBA]
*  (2013-2019) Brian Krzanich [Just an undergrad degree]
*  (2019-2021) Bob Swan [Just a MBA]
*  (2021-2024) Pat Gelsinger [Just a masters degree]

TL/DR - they stopped being a tech company and became a finance and ""too-big-to-fail-lobbying"" company.

You can see that in their top management.

Note that this isn't unique to Intel.   It applies to all tech companies

HP's a great history lesson for investors:

* Back when the individuals Hewlett and Packard (both Stanford Electrical Engineers) were running the company it was doing great. 
* Same with when John Young (Oregon State Electrical Engineer) was CEO. 
* Still did well with Lew Platt (Cornell Mechanical Engineer) as CEO.
* Then the place started falling apart when they put someone with an education in Medieval History (sadly not kidding here) as CEO, and it's been finance people ever since, continuing its downward spiral. || Bro, it is his fault. We are not blaming the first year on the guy. It’s been 5 years. At some point, he needs to take responsibility. Also a company does not have 3 independent branches of government. The man literally ran as a ruler of the entire company. Compare that to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the difference is night and day.

He is literally at fault period. Intel new desktop CPU for both 13th and 14th gen crashes and replacements are under his supervision. || Ssshhhheeeeiiiitttt

He made the decision to ignore , then lie about the 13 and 14 gen chips. Not to mention THEY ARE STILL BEING SOLD RIGHT NOW. || I don't really follow Intel close enough to know what he has changed or the problems he inherited. And I'm just a regard so if stock go up, he good, if stock go down, he bad. || Oops seems like I offended you. Thanks for reminding me that this is Reddit and all the snowflakes hang out here. || I didn’t mean literally no customers. But they haven’t had enough sales of foundry capacity and they way overbuilt capacity and then had to delay plans etc. Microsoft contract is up to $15B. DoD is a few billion more. But Intel has spent $50B on foundry in the last two years alone. They need way more sales of high end processes. || The size of that deal was left very vague, and probably conditional. The numbers sound large, but running a foundry is insanely expensive. Intel has invested $50 billion in the last couple years alone. A few billion in sales to Amazon, the DOD, and Microsoftare not going to cut it. And those are multi year deals, that’s not a single year of revenue. || Yes, multi billion dollar, multi year deal on 18A || It more likely suggests that progress toward 18A is so far along that Pat is no longer what is needed. His biggest strength is not the biggest current issue of 18A is healthy. || >Old ceo is source of all worlds problems

>Get new ceo

>New ceo becomes source of all problems

Why does the general public have so much trouble with this? It is so easy and lazy to look at bad results and say shit CEO, and good results and say good CEO, when they only have so much control over it.

I think the reason is that because it's so hard to argue against something so lazy but easy to propagate, and so it just becomes the accepted norm. || I'd say you're spot on. Despite AMD's growth, Intel still has majority share in x86 space, yet they keep posting massive quarterly losses. How is that anything else but mismanagement. || While I agree they have an overall they need better leadership, an MBA/marketing guy sunk Intels ship a long time ago when Pat was a simple engineer. You need an engineer to turn this ship around || BK was never an engineer. He was a chem major from SJSU in the early 80s. Back then, if you had a heartbeat and could spell your name, you got into SJSU. He was a glorified fab manager who was good at playing politics. He just rode the rising tide of predictable Dennard Scaling until 10nm. When shit hit the fan in process dev, the Fab guy as CEO should have been the perfect guy for the job, instead he was the one to F it up. Because he didn't really know shit about technology (Intel decided against using EUV under BK). 


 I swear hearing him talk in person about the Spectre and Meltdown bugs (while he insider traded all his stock) was cringe -- he actually used ""throwing away a Starbucks cup into the trash can"" as an analogy to the bug. No doubt that dumb analogy was cooked up by his Bain consultants.  || BK was a Chemical Engineer and office politician. He climbed to the top of the greasy pole by aggressively embracing DEI (before the term was coined). As is often the case with mid-wits, he packed the senior benches with similar types. || Not even just those. Look at the semiconductor etf SOXX. Literally could have just bought a general semiconductor etf and you would have outperformed. They’re not just underperforming the indexes but all their peers as well. Bagholders will always be delusional. || Yes, apple didn't want Intel atom because it was too power hungry. That's why they went to Intel and proposed designing a new chip for the iPhone, which Intel said no to because Intel didn't think the iPhone would sell well enough to justify work on their end. 

So again, it had little to do with Intel's own chips.  The big mistake was when Intel rejected collaborating on the iPhone chip, where tsmc took the offer. || I see, thank you for answering! || Yes... Yet they're both sitting on massive market shares, which is all that matters when it comes to approval of such transactions. It would be monopolistic. || Not just debt, NVDA’s strength is being a fabless design company, taking over Intel would drag all of their growth and profitability ratios down. It would be like towing an anchor. || My bad, then I was naively wrong! || x86 competition is fierce with AMD having way better designs. Apple has proven they can develop a super perfomant and efficient consumer chip with a different ISA + have a good chunk of software running on it (part of their success comes from owning the whole development stack and setting the rules). Nvidia rumours of developing CPUs will make it even harder for Intel to compete in data center/client.

Pat was betting the whole company mostly on foundry, not products. Foundry is what has the best growth potential. They have not been clear regarding how healthy 18A is, unless Pat has a serious personal issue its abrupt leave raises some questions. The guy that was ""all-in on 18A"" is leaving before seeing if the bet paid off. Foundries are not expected to properly work until EOY 2025/2026.

The US government says it is super important to also fab bleeding edge chips in-house. Considering how Taiwan is keeping the best tech in their country, TSMC's fabs in AZ won't really provide bleeding edge nodes in the US. Maybe Samsung/Intel will, but only one company has a proven bleeding edge tech and makes 90% of the most advanced chips in the world, the other players are struggling and have yet to prove they have good yields and scalability.

Not financial advice but I would invest elsewhere. || Jesus Christ, calling Pat Gelsinger ""just a masters degree"". An excerpt from his Wiki page:

>Gelsinger was the lead architect of the 4th generation 80486 processor introduced in 1989. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel's history. Mentored by Intel CEO Andrew Grove, Gelsinger became the company's CTO in 2001, leading key technology developments, including Wi-Fi, USB, Intel Core and Intel Xeon processors, and 14 chip projects.

Back in the 2000s when he led Intel to worldwide dominance he used to be called ""Kicking Pat"" Gelsinger by the tech tabloids. Now he's always been just someone with a master's degree. || Lmao acting like Paul Otellini’s reign didn’t produce innovation is some full on simple Jack level understanding of the semiconductor world. || Why do you make MBAs look better than ""just a masters degree"". Most of the time MBA's are essentially bought and even from the good universities they are not really on par with an actual Master's which normally prepares you for a PhD || cause having a phD automatically you a better person to lead a company than anyone else? || yea, because it is the school that defines people

lmao some people are so fucking delusional, do you even have a degree? || I can tell you’re still in school because you think education matters once you’ve been in industry for 10+ years. || Sadly engineers are undervalued in corporate America. || And automotive and aviation. || So what you’re saying is engineers make great CEOs? That’s music to my ears as I’m an engineer too! Not the imaginary kind || It took AMD more than a decade (almost 2) to regein any sort of parity or advantage with intel and you expect Pat to somehow turn everything around in 3.5 years? Next gen fabs don't get built overnight. Not to mention that there have been a lot of people thag were simply not under his control, and he had to navigate. Supply chain problems, end of globalisation/trade wars.

I am not saying he didn't make any mistakes because he did. But overall the current situation is not on him || The truth is in the middle. He did inherit a mess, but also under his watch some big errors were made. || I think it’s been 3.5 years || Just fyi the AMD turn around started around 2013. Took solid 4 years for ryzen 1 architecture to hit retail || Fair enough, most honest redditor. Kind regards bro || So, the strategy with Intel allows to keep fabs running for many years. They don't need to recoup $50b immediately. || Sales of the very chips that are bricking people’s machines. 

Good luck. || Same problem in politics lol. The world is too complicated and people have attribution bias. || Satya Nadella ~~single handedly~~was instrumental in turning Microsoft around. Lisa Su ~~single handedly~~was instrumental in turning AMD around. || Thats how people are with everything.

Its no different then ancient Egyptian blaming the pharaoh for crop failures, and praising him for its success..

That doesn't mean the top guy doesn't have SOME say in how things play out, but people like to pin the results on complex system on one person. || Or maybe it was the CEO decision to ignore , then lie , and CONTINUE TO SELL UP TO TODAY bum chips that brick machines. || You are ignoring the point that Intel still produced shit laptop chips. If they had great laptop chips apple wouldn't have moved their laptop line away from Intel. || its funny how that works. Buying intel would give them something of substance actually worth more than what they have, but in delulu stock world it's bad. || It would be like a cruise ship towing a 100lb anchor || What if they can buy the design part and not the foundry part? 🤔 || Buying Intel would be good for profitability because they wouldn't have to rely on TSMC to produce their future chips. || Thats what I was thinking. You seem to know more about him then me, but trying to put Pat in with the 2 previous CEO's is disingenuous af.

And its funny how people shit on the the company being a financials company, but then go on to rate Pat's time as CEO based off share price. Thats like the most MBAesque way to measure a company. And these people are shitting on the MBA culture of finance that has invaded Intel, by measuring the company like the most base level mediocre MBA imaginable?

God this sub has some of the most brainlet takes... || I certainly didn't imply for them to look ""better"".

I thought I put them both in the bucket of

* *undervalues research when contrasted with PhDs* || Yeah…people seem to forget AMD was a joke for a long time || Yes it is. Simple facts. AMD decides to choose TSMC over their own fabs in mid 2015 proven to be better choice vs Intel decision of choosing their own fab thinking they can out compete TSMC innovation. Also, it literally took Lisa Su 1 year to reverse AMD trajectory and revert to growth both in stocks and returns. Just look at their 10q and market valuation. First year at 2014, she focused immediately on gaming, data center and immersive platforms and chose TSMC. Lisa was appointed at oct of 2014, discounting 2015. In one year, AMD went from 4 billion revenue (2016) to 6 billion (2018).

AMD continued to choose TSMC with Nvidia and Apple vs Intel. This alone is the biggest blunder Intel current CEO has made. He did not have the technical expertise to execute even today. 

AMD reversal did not take 10 years. That statement is unequivocally incorrect. AMD going from loss to growth was immediate. Intel went from growth to losses under the CEO leadership. Recent quarter revenue was down 6 percent. Intel CEO joined in 2021. By 2022 to 2023, revenue dropped to 54 billion same as 2011. Projected revenue for 2024 is 52 billion lower than 2011. || But it wasn't long after Lisa Su took the helm in 2014 that AMD started to rocket from basically crawling half-dead on the ground. She pivoted them towards going heavy on GPU technologies and heavily multithreaded architectures, at a time when single-core clocks were king. They also started giving up on  their homegrown GlobalFoundries and ramped up deals with competitor TSMC for their high-end nodes. These ""risky"" decisions arguably got them basically teetering at the edge of bankruptcy at $4/share to peaks of >$200 early this year. 

We got Polaris (RX 480) shortly after she became tech girl boss. They soon started to ""glue together cores"" for their high-end  CPUs, as Intel used to joke. But that lead them from crappy Bulldozer to the goated Zen architecture, and now we have 192-core monsters  like the AMD EPYC 9005.

Having the right person making the difficult decisions definitely can make all the difference. || I didn’t say they needed $50 billion immediately. But announcing $20 billion of sales over many years through the end of the decade does not add up to being the second largest foundry in the world by the end of the decade. Not by a longshot. || The seeds for azure were planted under ballmer || They didn't, still attribution bias.

They may have hired the right people, and pushed investments to the right products and outcomes. But everything a CEO does is rarely single handedly.

Do you take credit for everything your family does because ""well they are my kid so it's like I did it. Or well I chose to married that so I accomplished it single handedly."" Take that and multiply it by 10000x.

Or another example, you double your sales quota and everyone on your team 1.5x. Your manager single handedly increased his regions sales by over 50%? Maybe he enabled you, but maybe he got lucky to have a great team.

The main difference is a leaders actions and choices and micro-actions have far reaching consequences. Often unintended consequences. So your influence is important. However single handedly is a lazy attribution that gets thrown around a lot. || Once Apple started designing their own mobile chips in the early 2000s, it was only a matter of time before they would scale it up to their laptops as well in their typical vertically integrated fashion. Looking at the development timeline of the iPad chips, it's very likely the Apple Silicon roadmap was already being discussed while Steve Jobs was alive, and accelerated due to the failures of the Touch Bar era Macbooks. || They would have. Little later. || Sometimes less is more. || Why do you have that perspective? The manufacturing is the outdated, easier part of the process. It's akin to architecture versus framing. Should the framer on the construction site earn more than the architect in the office? After all, the architect is just designing, and doesn't make anything.

Obviously it is much harder to design a house than to assemble it. Same with chips. || Chips act money prevents that || That is a BIG assumption which is probably false. || They don't *have* to rely on TSMC currently either. Intel would be glad to get a piece of Nvidia's money and have their fabs making Nvidia chips instead of TSMC.

Their fabs are just not nearly as advanced as TSMC's. Nvidia uses TSMC over Intel by choice. || There are too many people on Reddit who believe that every leader of a tech company needs to be a PhD engineer.  Those are great qualifications but it's a joke to think that's the only group of people that can lead a tech company. || 'just a masters degree' and 'MBA' did feel like MBA was not ""just"" something even though an MBA is mostly laughed at while an actual Master's is often a lot more valuable. || Yeah, I expect intel to be in this position until at least the early 2030s. Stuff like this takes time. || Of course, but you weren't talking about them being the second largest foundry in the world. You were talking about them making back the money they invested in the hardware. || Satya Nadella picked the right people, that is a skill in itself. Napoleon didn't manage every victory on the battlefield and in politics himself either. He was crazy good at finding the right people and giving them the room to develop and use their skills.

It's kinda suprising you think ""single handedly"" is meant to be taken literally. || Wrong choice of word, replace by “instrumental”. || Exactly, see SaaS || The big selling point of a fab isn't necessarily just the ability to produce, it's the ability to aid design by adjusting and/or creating a process that can house the design. These consultations and co-developments is what TSMC is so good at. Designing a specific transistor layout or transistor type within the capabilities of a process, to enable a certain compute unit to be bult as example.  
  
Designing a house is the easy part, making sure that design uses the right materials and is structurally sound is a whole other thing. That's why over here you generally have a static engineer, who does exactly that, verify the structural integrity and material choices.  
  
This is where Intel now really took the loss, they managed to fuck up the process part; as a fab provider. That's gonna be a huge lost of trust issue. You can also see this with Boeing, it's a loss of confidence, which for investors generally is much more indicative too. || What if there is only one single framer with the skillset to carry out the architect's design? Where is the barrier to entry? Is it harder to train more framers or harder for architects to come up with new designs? || It's not a big assumption. TSMC has been hiking prices and Nvidia has historically relied on them. Intel actually owns fabs. || Intel has purchased all of ASML's high-NA machines for 2024 - would that not suggest that Intel's fabs will be better than TSMC's soon? || Had he stayed and they were able to execute their roadmap even somewhat successfully they would've been in a much better place by the end of the decade. Now it's questionable if they will ever get there at all || I was talking about their over investment in capacity they couldn’t sell. They invested like that because of their goal to be the second largest. They aren’t getting traction and that is my point. It’s all related || Thank you for this insight. It's even worse than I thought with that company. || It is harder to train architects. If there was one single framer then fire the project manager || There are still a ton of assumptions there. NVDA is a fabless company, buying a major fab would be a huge risk. They have basically no manufacturing expertise, that is not their strength. You also have to assume that INTC's manufacturing will be able to catch TSMC, which is hardly guaranteed. || That's not how it works... There's a lot more than just the machines to the manufectoring process (patents, experience, experienced employees, customers and partnerships, etc.). || Intel does not have the experience or resources but NVIDIA might.."

Trimmed at 550 still own it overweight. || Wow || Bubble can expand for a long time before it pops || If there continues to be booms and busts as quickly as there has been the last few years it makes sense that more people would eventually be able to identify the hallmarks of a bubble. On the other hand there were people pointing to the Shiller ratio 10 years ago and saying it’s at one of the higher points in history and predicting a crash based off of it. People are using pretty much the same argument today. Most would agree that there is justification for valuations to increase somewhat over time with maturity of markets and increased certainty that some form of economic and technological progress will likely continue to be made. Comparing to historical valuations doesn’t work in my opinion. If we get a dramatic increase in valuations that is much higher than the average increase has been the last decades I’d be concerned. It has been pretty rapid but so was the fall in 2022, and capital allocation on the whole now seems a fair bit more rational than it did then. 

Calling it a bubble is a pretty extreme term that I don’t think applies right now. It suggests fundamentals have gone out the window and people are expecting an everlasting rally. There are little booms and busts and people getting carried away with certain names but this isn’t the overall market sentiment. || Guidance + margin growth. || South Korea is just 3 companies though || South Korea is not an emergent market my friend.

People just let the downvotes happen when people said PLTR was the big AI play back then. || I also bought shortly after IPO in my Roth account. That saved me because I don't really touch that account too much, honestly I just forgot about it. I would have probably sold for a loss in my trading account. However I did fully exit my position just now at $71 as I can't justify the runup post Trump election other than the promise of corruption.

Buying heavily at this valuation doesn’t make sense to me, not sure it really counts as a lotto ticket stock anymore as I think the upside is fairly limited now. It was trading about 3.5 and people were saying this, fair enough, but it’s already made such big gains since then. At what point do you think it stops having those outsized returns potential? || That would be cool. MSFT has been treading water since early in the year. || Holders will tell you to hold or add obviously. If you didn't do any research I would just sell || Both are becoming interesting. I would hold or buy more || > I didn’t do any research before buying.

What a horrible thing to do. || First, it's ok to make a mistake, as long as you learn from it. 

Second, estimate your fair value on each. This can help sure up your conviction. 

Third, if you don't have conviction, sell. 

Fourth, if you have conviction and it's below fair value, buy more!

I have no opinion on TMDX, but X hyped it big time. I'm long NU. I think it's a great company with a long runway. There's a lot of writing on it of you search X and Substack. That might help. || Stop investing till you know what you are doing. || Been bullish on this ticker for years now. It's delivered consistent gains for the most part (with the exception of 1 major hiccup, resolved with the firing of their CEO). My position has become quite substantial with the cumulative growth. I'm still holding with no intention of divesting anytime soon. || It really is a different world if papa is president (across the aisle lol) || There’s hope on a longer timeline.

Clown. || Sorry - the post you're trying to make mentions a stock that currently breaks rule #7.

Any of the following criteria is considered breaking the rule:


* Typically trades under $5 or previously traded under $5 within 6 months

* Below $300 million market cap or previously traded under 300m before the pump within 6 months

* Most OTC / PINK stocks

* Usually has missed reporting/filings; no auditing or odd auditing issues

* Low volume or wide bid/ask spread

* Doesn't have any big name institutional holders

 * If the biggest institutional holder is a stock promoter then they don't count as an institutional holder

* All SPACs

I Want to Hear Your Thoughts on the Qualities Intel’s Next CEO Should Have and Why,"With Pat Gelsinger retiring, the company is once again searching for a CEO who can steer it through its challenges.

Who do you think Intel needs next as CEO, and why? Should it be an insider with deep technical expertise or someone from outside with a fresh perspective? How do you think the leadership transition will unfold in the coming months/years?

Here’s a quick summary of Intel’s past CEOs, their departures, and the criticisms they faced, for reference:  


|**CEO**|**Predecessor's Reason for Departure**|**Public Criticism or Perceived Failures**|**Successor’s Key Attributes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Pat Gelsinger**|Bob Swan replaced due to lack of technical background|Struggled to regain process leadership; delays in 7nm; stiff competition from AMD and TSMC|Deep technical expertise, Intel veteran, proven leader at VMware|
|**Bob Swan**|Brian Krzanich resigned after a policy violation|Failed to address manufacturing delays; lacked vision to compete with AMD/ARM-based chips|Stability-focused leader with strong financial acumen|
|**Brian Krzanich**|Paul Otellini retired citing personal reasons|Poor handling of mobile market diversification; failed to anticipate ARM dominance|Manufacturing and operations expertise, Intel insider|
|**Paul Otellini**|Craig Barrett retired as part of a planned transition|Missed opportunities in mobile chips, allowing Qualcomm and ARM to dominate|Strategic thinker, strong marketing and client focus|
|**Craig Barrett**|Andrew Grove stepped down after transforming Intel|Slow diversification beyond PCs; overexposure to dot-com volatility|Deep engineering and manufacturing expertise|

**Questions to consider**:

* What should Intel prioritize in its next CEO: technical skills, operational expertise, or a focus on profitability?
* What qualities or background should this leader have to address Intel's challenges?
* How do you think this transition will impact Intel’s market position and stock performance?

Semiconductors is highly relationship driven you best know there is favoritism between TSM/NVDA/AMD due to their CEOs. SMCIs getting propped up by NVDA as we speak.

Also having a Taiwanese CEO will prolly attract more talent from Taiwan who are the best at fabs || Me. I’m guarantee it’ll do no worse than || Most important thing: a time machine.  So that he can warn that guy's nana. || Strong.  Big and strong.  Like an ox.

It’s not worth risking your capital on them.

And it’s certainly not worth your time exploring as an investment. 

They’re dead money. || At this point Intel needs a dictator with vision, drive, lots of energy, and the ability to focus that energy on fixing an entrenched company that is stuck in deep mud surrounded by quicksand.

They need to come in and choose to be either a chip designer OR a fab company, not both.

Get rid of a LOT of people that are slowing the company down. Get rid of the old company culture that put them where they are now (any manager that has been there for 5 years or more).

Not an idiot who wasted his time sharing bible verses on social media instead of fixing Intel.

This person will need to be RUTHLESS. || Young  engineer  who understands current market trends || A bankruptcy lawyer probably. Just kiddin ofc. They need the chip equivalent of a Larry Culp at GE. Everything has to be rethought. All the stakes in non-core businesses will have to get flogged to shore up the balance sheet, so Mobileye and Altera first and foremost. Second, a separation of the fabs and the design will probably have to be on the table again. The manufacturing expansion will likely be scaled back dramatically. The Gelsinger plan was excessively ambitious from the start, aiming to turn around both their manufacturing and design businesses at the same time. I mean, they should be happy if they can win one of those battles instead of both. || They either need to focus on foundry or products. They need to either compete with TSMC or Nvidia. One is much easier than the other; fight a bear or an elephant? It's still a tough battle either way but I think with Trump they have a better shot with foundry. USA has too many designers.

Super Micro Computer pops 15% after special committee finds no ‘evidence of misconduct’,"Super Micro Computer surged more than 14% after a special committee ruled that it found “no evidence of misconduct” at the embattled AI server maker, and appointed a new chief accounting officer.

“The evidence reviewed by the Special Committee did not raise any substantial concerns about the integrity of Supermicro’s senior management or Audit Committee, or their commitment to ensuring that the Company’s financial statements are materially accurate,” the company said in a release.

Super Micro said it’s also currently searching for a new chief financial officer, and looking to fill additional financial leadership positions. The company appointed current Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller Kenneth Cheung as its chief accounting officer.

The news from Super Micro Computer comes on the heels of a volatile year for the company. Shares sank in August after Hindenburg Research revealed a short position in the company, saying that it found “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation” and the company delayed the release of its annual filing.

Those troubles continued, with Ernst & Young resigning as the company’s auditor in October due to concerns about the board’s governance and independence. Shares are up about 30% this year, after giving back much of its rally. Last month, the company averted a potential delisting from the Nasdaq following its monster plunge.

Among the findings, the committee ruled that the conclusions reached by Ernst & Young in its resignation were “not supported by the facts” and that the firm’s audit committee exhibited “appropriate independence and generally provided proper oversight.”

The special committee consisted of Super Micro’s board, counsel from Cooley LLP and a team from forensic accounting firm Secretariat Advisors.

But  the funniest fact comes from a now very big stockholder: Susquehanna. Their analysts shouted sell on every dog and pony show, just to buy stock and call options on the cheap.

My point being less to gloat but more so to prod everyone who was wrong about them to reconsider their approach and how they ended up so wrong. It’s so trivially easy to go “question of fraud and accounting resignation = delisting and stock to 0” that a child could be taught that, if you’re not adding value well above and beyond that to make your predictions more accurate etc your analysis really is useless.

This happens in cases of minor fraud and accounting errors and isn't a major problem for an auditor.  Whatever is happening here was substantial enough for a big 4 auditor to voluntarily end their relationship with a high profile s&p 500 company.  The fact that smci is trying to sweep it under the rug is a major red flag.  They've been public of over a decade, they aren't new to public company reporting requirements and internal controls.  It'll be interesting to see how it plays out. || Is fraud really confirmed tho || I don't think Hindenburg is the problem... we are the problem. OK, those of us who sold.

* Supermicro says that ""independent"" committee found no problems. They profit.
* Hindenburg says they falsified books and broke export laws. They did already profit.
* Susquehanna makes their analysts fuck everybody who listens to them by issuing sell calls and buying the stock. They profit, today probably over a hundred millions again.

Hindenburg at least did put its money where its mouth was. What Susquehanna did is probably worse and they  probably made more money with it than Hindenburg.

Now Supermicro will profit in the future, but only if what they said is true. They are still worth less than half than before. If they really sell their systems like hot cakes and they really have the best patents and liquid cooled systems and that systems really have such a good margin... so fuck Wall Street.

If you believe in the company,  then Hindenburg reports are the greatest opportunity of a lifetime.

Instead, you're complaining that it ""should be illegal"". Other than throwing a tantrum because you likely got caught with your pants down when the stock tanked, why should it be illegal? || As someone who’s a senior at one of these firms, I’m in my mid 20s and have no idea what I’m doing half the time lol || Do a little DD before you invest.

That's 2 bro! || I'm wondering if stickman was referring to Hindenburg accidentally. Not an accounting firm but still relevant. || Or at least none that can be proven, they are not stupid (I suppose). || Agreed. Either they throw bodies at it or turn a blind eye. EY has several spectacular cockups (wirecard, stagecoach). 

To walk away is a huge red flag. || No because both previous auditors dipped || Except when they are totally wrong and a legitimate company gets pummeled because of it || If you swap the D and T you get Teloitte and Douche. || No, he's referencing Deloitte.  They are the other big 4 auditor who audited Smci for over a decade until resigning in 2023.  It's unusual for an auditor to resign a job unless there are problems that the company is unwilling to resolve.  If you look back at Deloitte's opinions, they got ugly in the later years and were littered with critical audit matters for related party transactions and other issues. || All these companies a well within their right to file suit against Hindenburg.  Few ever do.  What does that tell you? || thats the point. if a good company gets slandered their stock get pummeled for like a week and its back to all ok again. no real harm to rhe company unless they really need to use the stock price for fund raising. 

if hindenburg gets it wrong like twice they lose credibility and whatever they say wont matter anymore, so there is no incentive for fraud || But companies can say whatever they want positively as long as they say ""our best estimate"" and it's fine. || Thanks man, I clearly need to do more reading about this place. They should know that they're really only good for pump and dump. Sadly I have a full time job that requires OT frequently and play around with this stuff to unwind, so I don't get to really research hard and do many pump and dumps. But once I heard about the shit that went down in 2017/2018 and read Hindenburg's research eval, I was completely disgusted. I'll look into the Deloitte scandal. 

Secretariat LLC. Heh. Tongue in cheek reference? || That it’s probably hard to definitively prove damages, lol. || The more important factor is likely that if they sue then Hindenburg can subpoena them, which they can use to dig up evidence that their claims are correct (meaning that Hindenburg isn't guilty of slander/libel). And if the company is guilty of doing shady things then they definitely don't want Hindenburg subpoenaing evidencing of their guilt for the world to see in court filings (not just for reputational damage, but because if there's real crimes being committed then it could lead to the government filing criminal charges against them)."

GM to sell stake in battery cell plant to joint venture partner for roughly $1 billion,"General Motors plans to sell its stake in a $2.6 billion electric vehicle battery cell plant in Michigan to its joint venture partner LG Energy Solution, the automaker announced Monday.

The Detroit carmaker said it expects to recoup its investment in the facility, which a source familiar with the plans said is anticipated to be roughly $1 billion. The sale is part of a non-binding agreement between the two companies that’s anticipated to close during the first quarter of next year, GM said.

The nearly completed, 2.8 million-square-foot plant in Lansing, Michigan, was expected to be the third battery cell facility of the joint venture, known as Ultium Cells LLC, following plants in Ohio and Tennessee that have already opened and are operational.

The Lansing plant was announced in January 2022, and the two companies first announced their joint venture five years ago.

GM’s move comes as the automaker attempts to right-size production of electric vehicles and confronts slower-than-expected consumer demand. It also comes amid uncertainty regarding federal incentives for manufacturing and purchasing EVs in the U.S. under President-elect Donald Trump.

The automaker said the sale does not impact its overall ownership stake in the joint venture or its future plans for a separate joint venture plant with LGES rival Samsung SDI.

“We believe we have the right cell and manufacturing capabilities in place to grow with the EV market in a capital efficient manner,” GM CFO Paul Jacobson said in a release. “When completed, this transaction will also help LG Energy Solution meet demand by leveraging capacity that’s nearly ready to come online and it will make GM even more efficient.” 

GM said the South Korean battery supplier will have immediate access to the Lansing facility to begin installation of equipment. The plant, which currently employs nearly 100 people, was expected to begin operating by the end of this year.

Separate from the sale of its stake in the Lansing facility, GM on Monday announced it will extend a 14-year battery technology partnership with LGES to include the development of an emerging type of battery cell called prismatic cells.

Prismatic cells are a flat, rectangular shape with a rigid enclosure, which allows for space-efficient packaging within battery modules and packs. GM said the cells are expected to reduce EV weights and costs, while simplifying manufacturing by reducing the number of modules and mechanical components.

“We’re focused on optimizing our battery technology by developing the right battery chemistries and form factors to improve EV performance, enhance safety, and reduce costs. By extending our partnership with LG Energy Solution, we’re taking an important step towards these goals,” Kurt Kelty, GM vice president of battery cell and pack, said in a release.

GM had previously said it planned to expand its battery cell technologies from its flat “Ultium” pouches to include other forms such as prismatic cells.

"""Existencial question"" about common stocks.","Let's suppose that a few financial analysts have evaluated the intrinsic value of the shares of company X. By ""intrinsic"", I mean not only the value of the company underlying assets (tangible and intangible) minus liabilities but also any other type of fundamental analysis. By consensus, the intrinsic value was estimated at $1 per share.

However, the market value is $0.70. In other words, the stock is being sold at a discount. Is there any kind of arbitrage that forces the market price to converge towards the intrinsic value? I haven't yet found any reason that would encourage the increase in the market price beyond the usual speculation. Even if the stock has an intrinsic value of $1, shareholders cannot liquidate it outside the secondary market...

Arbitrage in derivatives markets is easier to understand. Suppose the market price of gold is M. To secure this price in the future, an investor can buy a gold call option at a price P (strike price), where M = P on the date of purchase of the option. After some time, the market price of gold is M+N. Consequently, the option has gained a value of N, that is: it can be sold directly for N to another investor. Even if there is no liquidity in the derivatives market to sell the option for N, the investor can exercise the right to buy gold for P and sell the gold in the spot market for M+N. From this exercise, he would obtain the same N.

In the equity market, I don't see a similar way for an investor to liquidate the intrinsic value of the stock. It doesn't make much sense either. So, there's only speculation left. If that's really the case, it's quite problematic. As a famous economist said: ""Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.""",skwex,2024-12-04 04:59:18,0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h61ksu/existencial_question_about_common_stocks/,None,">Is there any kind of arbitrage that forces the market price to converge towards the intrinsic value?

Not unless you count dividends or share buybacks. You'll get paid by the company directly, but the price can do whatever it wants.

>I don't see a similar way for an investor to liquidate the intrinsic value of the stock

You'd see the way if you didn't ignore the one ultimate purpose of company stock for investors ;) || I disagree with commenter below honestly. If the true intrinsic value of a company was one dollar, it would necessarily converge to that price as market participants spotted the bargain. That's not speculative return either in the sense that a share is a certificate of ownership; you'd literally be buying a dollar (later) for 70 cents today. Essentially so long as people wish to find bargains, price will eventually converge with intrinsic value. The inability for individual shareholders to liquidate is almost\* irrelevant, in part because there are players that can theoretically buy the entire company in full. 

\*An addition to discount rate should be applied for partial ownership v. full ownership of a company in some models. || Which is it? Besides being able to vote and speculating price appreciation. What am I missing? || Even if investors spot bargains, like the example of buying 1 dollar for 70 cents, they cannot liquidate the share's intrinsic value, right? The certificate of ownership does not give the investor rights to sell  company's assets to redeem/liquidate their shares. Simply, there's no arbitrage mechanism available, like the one we see with ETFs and their NAV.

For that reason, there must be another driving factor pushing the ""at discount"" market price to its intrinsic value. Since it's not arbitrage, then what remains is speculation, right? The prospect that a company will pay back in the form of dividends or buybacks and also hoping that someone will be willing to buy back at a higher price than I bought. I'm not seeing anything else. || Dividends and share buybacks. Primarily the former as it's a direct payment to you. Though in a decently efficient market they are both the same thing, practically speaking. A 10% reduction in outstanding shares, all else being equal, also results in a 10% higher stock price relative to where it would've been otherwise. || Right, but not all companies pay dividends. I'm also supposing that a shareholder cannot force a company to buyback at a higher price, right? || Not all companies pay dividends *now*. That doesn't change the fact that ultimately that's what their purpose is. That is where your stock returns cash from the company.

If it was known as a fact that a given company was never to pay out a dividend, would never buy back any of its shares, has zero or negative book value (so that even in liquidation no cash would be returned) and is never going to be acquired by a company not having these qualities, its market value would be zero. || That actually makes sense. The traditional explanation that I see online is that a share represents a partial ownership of the company, e.g: company's assets and earnings. Because of that, I thought that the intrinsic value would be a minimum guaranteed by some sort of arbitrage-like mechanism. But it doesn't make sense for such a thing to exist. Shareholders can't simply demand a company to sell assets.   
  
So, following your reasoning, if the current market cap is less than the original value generated during IPO, that means that the market has less faith that the company will ever be able to pay dividends in the future, right?

So, essentially, besides any buybacks, it's all about dividends, right? || > if the current market cap is **less than the original value generated during IPO**, that means that the market has less faith that the company will ever be able to pay dividends in the future, right?

I don't quite understand the part I made bold (Edit: if you just meant market cap at IPO, I do get it now), but effectively a lower market cap means that people expect lesser dividend payments in the future (or a lower chance of there being any at all), you got that on point.

Keep in mind, though, this future can be decades out. Look at Amazon, they haven't returned any meaningful cash to shareholders ever since they went public. But still they are worth $2T because the expectation is that they will at some point do that. Even if that point is another 20 years in the future. || What I meant (in the bold part) was a market share price inferior to the intrinsic value (the company's total assets and such divided by the number of outstanding shares). I didn't understand how that could be even possible. But, indeed, having less prospects of the company ever paying dividends is a good explanation.

Let me see if I got this right:   
  
With bonds, the value is in the coupon yield until the maturity date. Then, I get the principal back.  
  
With stocks, the value is in the of dividend yield potentially ""forever"". When the company doesn't pay any dividends, then the market price (price speculation aside) is all about dividend prospects. Well, since selling the shares at the same price that I bought is not guaranteed, the dividend cashflow will pay back the principal and potentially more. Is that the whole idea? || Yup, that's it. At least the way I had it taught to me and see it myself 👍 || Thank you for clarifying your fellow stranger. Really appreciate it."
Costco tariffs coming to a store near you! ,"I love Costco, the stores are awesome and they have everything but i feel the stock has gotten out of control.

The PE is 59! you are paying $59 for every $1 they earn. Thats just irresponsible investing.

They are expanding across Asia but they are also facing stiff competition from home base Chinese companies. And one thing china is very good at: copying everyone else and selling stuff for cheap to eliminate competition. Im not saying Costco will fail but it wont be easy for them outside the US.

Lastly we have the tariff situation. The proposition is a 10% tariff on Chinese goods and a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. This is a bit of a problem because Costco is the #12 importer in the US for 2024. Most common origin is China. Walmart got smart and started to protect themselves and reducing Chinese imports but Costco and their business model, will have a much harder time navigating with keeping the prices attractive.

All their top trading partners are Chinese companies.

Costco sells ALOT of electronics and appliances, its one of their biggest categories. If a TV cost $1000 today, staring Jan 20th(day one in office) it will cost $1600. Appliances going up $100's of dollars is hyper inflation and people are already stretched thin going into the holidays.

Im really looking forward to this upcoming earnings release and how they will guide going forward. I guarantee you all the analyst questions will be about tariffs and profit margins.

Costco's profit margin for fiscal 2023 was 2.6%. Costco's profit margin for 2024 was 2.9%. They can only raise the membership and prices so much before people starting shopping elsewhere.

Anyone else buying the NU dip?,"I’ve been an investor in NU for a while now. I firmly believe the market is panic selling because Warren Buffet sold 19% of his stake in the company.

Today the company is down again because Citi bank downgraded its rating on NU to a sell.

Why do people care that Citi bank downgraded to a sell? It’s literally a bank that could potentially have to rival NU soon if they break into USA markets. Citi bank is just worried about a rapidly growing, amazing company.

If anything, the downgrade should be seen as a good sign. It shows that american banks like Citi are starting to feel a bit of pressure from how fast NU has been able to expand its user base.

I know Brazil has made changes to its financial regulations. However, NU is rapidly expanding its user base to other countries. Plus, Brazils projected annual GDP growth per year is very good.

Do you guys agree?

EDIT:

(Thanks for all your thoughts. I’ve realized there are a few key things I overlooked.

I previously thought the stock was heavily owned by retail investors, similar to SoFi’s stock. I naively assumed this because the stock is frequently discussed on social media. Due to this preconceived notion, I believed the stock price would be significantly influenced by analyst ratings. I still think a large number of people have started to sell because of Warren Buffett reducing his stake and Citi’s sell recommendation. However, I now see that the primary factors driving this downturn are geopolitical and economic risks in Brazil.

My updated assessment is that the stock is being sold for a few very valid reasons. Firstly, Brazil’s inflation has been rising over the past few quarters. Secondly, Donald Trump has threatened BRICS nations with 100% tariffs if they decide to create a currency to rival the U.S. dollar. Thirdly, Warren Buffett sold 19% of his stake in the company. Fourthly, the value of Brazil’s currency has been declining and recently hit historic lows compared to the U.S. dollar. Finally, Brazil’s government spending was recently cut, potentially signaling a slowdown in their economy.

Overall, people are very concerned about the economic and geopolitical risks surrounding NU, especially since it is a Brazilian company. Brazil has a historically unstable economy and is currently facing economic headwinds that are amplified by the risk of potential tariffs.

I’m taking a cautious approach from here on out. I won’t be selling any shares, but I also won’t be buying more until the stock price consolidates and the Brazilian economy stabilizes.

I’m still very bullish on NU because the company has grown unbelievably fast in just 11 years. They survived Brazil’s economic collapse in 2014–2016, and they also weathered the last round of U.S. tariffs on Brazil in 2018. I believe NU will continue to expand rapidly into other Latin American countries, which will reduce its exposure to Brazilian tariffs and economic challenges. The CEO and management team are extremely competent, and I believe in their ability to navigate these challenges in the long term.

The worst-case scenario would be if the BRICS nations successfully create a new currency. Even then, I still believe NU will be okay due to its expansion into other markets. For now, I’m holding and remain very bullish on the business.)",Far_Version9387,2024-12-02 20:34:37,27,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h4wyxh/anyone_else_buying_the_nu_dip/,None,"If you're focused on Warren Buffet and Citi as the main drivers here, you have no idea what's actually going on.

Citi has nothing to do with this and it's doubtful NU could pass the regulatory framework to operate in the US anyway. Even if it made changes to meet them, there's a ton of competition in the Fintech space here.

IMO Nu is a sell today because delinquency rates and provisions will go up a lot in the short term (1-3 years).

My reasons to think this:

1- Their clients are low income, class C and D.

2- Brazil is in it’s way to a major crisis with current rates and government spending. || >Why do people care that Citi bank downgraded to a sell? It’s literally a bank that could potentially have to rival NU soon if they break into USA markets. Citi bank is just worried about a rapidly growing, amazing company.

1. They don't. Analyst ratings basically just reflect market sentiment. 

2. This is huge cope. Citi is not worried about Nu. First, Nu doesn't really compete in a lot of spaces with Citi, like investment banking or many services outside of basically consumer banking. Second, customers at Citi aren't going to jump to Nu. The people who are banking with Citi are doing so because of the name brand/legacy/availability. Nu does not compare in those areas. Nu is competing for customers from banks like Ally if they come to the US, not Citi/JPM/WF.

>If anything, the downgrade should be seen as a good sign. It shows that american banks like Citi are starting to feel a bit of pressure from how fast NU has been able to expand its user base.

Good luck gambling. || I am a long term holder of NU stock and got in at an average point of 7.

I expect losses from bad debt will only go higher when the currency weakens and would be a huge pain in the neck.

NU has no moat in US, its biggest competitor is MELI , both aggressively expansion their fintech business in Mexico .

Its overall Latin macro concerns drag down NU recently || What you're missing is that Nubank is very popular among Brazilians and Mexicans, and there's a huge community of both in the US. They might not enter to compete with big players at first, but they do have a path to it. || In my opinion, Tarrifs on Brazil won’t affect NU. I understand that Brazil’s fiscal reforms have been the big driving force in this recent sell off, but the stock would not fall nearly as bad if Buffet hadn’t sold.

Definitely a long shot that NU will compete with Citi but I still think they’re worried about how fast NU has become a lead bank in Brazil and how fast and successfully they’ve expanded into other countries. || It’s true that Nubank (NU) faces macroeconomic challenges in Brazil, including the recently proposed fiscal reforms and currency volatility. However, Short-term volatility shouldn’t overshadow its strategic position and scalability in Latin America.

NU has revolutionized banking in Brazil by providing a low-cost, digital-first experience to an underserved population. Unlike traditional banks, it charges minimal fees, which resonates deeply with its 80+ million users.

NU’s freemium model ensures a steady inflow of customers, and its focus on cross-selling premium products (credit, insurance, and investments) has been effective. The company continues to grow its customer base and diversify its offerings, which could mitigate economic headwinds over time.

For the facts, Brazil remains one of the largest and most underbanked markets globally, giving them a significant runway for growth despite short-term economic challenges.

While Brazilian tariffs and fiscal reforms are real challenges, they has demonstrated resilience by growing its user base during previous economic crises. The company also operates in local currencies, reducing the risk from US policy changes like tariffs.

If you’re investing with a multi-year horizon, their ability to dominate underbanked markets and expand its ecosystem makes it a compelling growth story. || >If you're focused on Warren Buffet and Citi as the main drivers here, you have no idea what's actually going on. Last week the Brazilian government announced fiscal reforms that would cut spending and raise taxes. Brazilian stocks and their currency dropped across the board.

For OP, if you're not keeping up with that countries politics (in addition to that of the US), you probably shouldn't be investing in these companies. Especially in a country that's so different and arguably less stable than the US || I’ve come to a similar conclusion. I think NU will succeed in the long run.

NU is not going to be a competitor to Citi and other big players in the financial sector, at least in the short to mid-term.

I highly doubt that considering you can buy crypto on Nubank. || I agree and I still have my shares. My comment was just pushing back on OP's reasons for the drop.

I would bet they originally invested after seeing articles and videos that kept pointing out Buffet was a shareholder. Add in the Citi news and they worked backwards to a conclusion using the only info they knew. Made them completely correct about the panic selling but wayyyy off base about why it was happening. || True that NU has no moat in USA, but neither do most banks. (in my opinion) || I agree, I think there’s potential but it’s definitely not something that is certain or something that will happen soon. || Just curious, but why do you think a 100% tariff from Brazil's second-largest trading partner would not affect NU? || Buffet sold? When? || I'm Brazilian, and what Nubank has accomplished here is unprecedented in the world for a bank in \~10y. 56% of adults in the country have Nubank, and you can’t go anywhere without spotting someone using their credit card. The market is punishing them for not growing fast enough in Mexico and Colombia, but growth is picking up quickly, and they’re already making waves in those markets. It took a few years for them to gain traction in Brazil too—this isn’t an overnight success story.

What’s even more important is their strategy: starting with credit cards, moving to checking accounts (giving them access to cheap funding), and then expanding into a full portfolio of products—investments, loans, insurance, crypto, and even a cell phone carrier.

I’m confident they’re not stopping at Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia. I wouldn’t be surprised if they announce expansion into new countries in 2025. || Because expected inflation is rising fast and the market is pricing in an increase in our Rates to 15% a year.

7% real rates…

Everytime we have a rate hike cycle the delinquency rates in our “lower income banks” rises fast.

Look at Bradesco company, similar demographic of clients and it is still sufering from the last rate hike cycle.

Things will be even worse now if the government doesn’t cut spending. || >I beg to differ on this

You said this and then said a bunch of shit that lines up exactly with what I said and/or doesn't address my points lol.

NU having potential long term doesn't mean that it's likely to compete with Citi significantly in the long term, because they're targeting different customers. 

NU is not a competitor to Citi or other major US banks, and NU being a bank is not influencing Citi's buy/sell recommendation. Besides, NU stock selling off doesn't actually do anything to give Citi an advantage in competing with NU, so it was just poor/dumb analysis by OP. 

Further, NU is overvalued anyway. They're valued similarly to other banks with the same number of consumers, but those competitors have much more profitable investment banking or services businesses. NU does not offer those services. || >If you think it’s gambling then take that up with Warren Buffet.

It's gambling if you don't know what you're talking about. Pretty sure buffet knows the banking industry fairly well. 

>But don’t be a know it all and say I have a lack of understanding.

Saying that NU is going to compete in the same space as Citi and that's why they're negative on NU reveals your level of understanding. || You should look at their Mexican and Colombian operations. Mexico's interbank rate is 10.74% and NU bank offers an annualized interest rate of 15% on deposits as of Nov this year. In Colombia NuBank offers 14% annual interest rates on savings accounts with daily interest deposits where the national bank has set an interest rate of 9.75%. So yeah..that's free money. Couple that with a high percentage of bad debt (not sure if the numbers are higher for these two markets compared to Brazil), I would say there is a cost to growth which is not apparent. || Mobile first vs companies that had an app. It’s the same thing now. Crypto first vs companies that allow crypto. It’s in a big time headwind now. Sell any and all pops. Wait to buy major dips. || Because NU’s company wouldn’t be directly impacted by the tariffs. In your opinion, Will the tariffs affect the overall economy enough to affect NU? || 6 days ago it was reported that he sold 19% of his stake in NU. Since then, there’s been a lot of bad/scary news about Brazils economy. Both these factors have caused the recent sell off, in my opinion. || It's still +45% YTD, so I wouldn't say this is any kid of punishment. || Good to know. I’m planning on holding them long term. My hope is that NU will become the biggest bank in all of South America. It’s a long shot but their user growth is so amazing that I could see it happening. || It seems that none of the Brazilian, bank stocks have gotten past their 2018-2020 highs.(please correct me if I over looked any) I’ve never noticed that before. It’s very scary since the last time Brazil got hit with tariffs was in 2018, and they were substantially less than the potential tariffs Trump will impose.

You have shown me the best bear evidence so far. Thank you for showing me that, it’s very good to know.

NU has a key difference from the other companies though. NU is a fintech so they have barely any property, unlike these more traditional banks.

Since NU is fully online and rapidly expanding to other countries. Do you think they could be different and survive high tariffs of 15% a year? || >NU is not a competitor to Citi or other major US banks, and NU being a bank is not influencing Citi’s buy/sell recommendation.

You can’t say for sure that NU being a bank isn’t influencing their decision. There’s been countless times that a company or analysts buy/sell recommendation has had ulterior motives. || Whatever makes you happy, bro. I specifically disagree with your statement: ""It’s literally a bank that could potentially have to rival NU soon if they break into USA markets"". That’s not going to happen. It would be suicidal for a Latin American bank to try entering the U.S. market with (literally hundreds), of banks in place, it's a nonsense, but hey, it’s a free world—you can believe what you want. || I never said NU is going to compete. I said that Citi and other American banks might be getting nervous from NU’s rapid and successful expansion. You can have your opinion but learn how to read first. || I think they absolutely would. The issue is that this would be a targeted tariff for a specific country, not a universal one against all imports. When the US previously targeted China, US companies mostly just shifted trade to places like Vietnam and India. The same thing would happen here. What percentage of products does the US get from Brazil that no other country in South/Central America can offer?

Brazil's economy is also doing well, but it's still not on a completely stable footing. The initial shock of tariffs would put a lot of pressure on it. Companies will take a defensive posture, stocks will likely take a downturn, banks will be more selective about lending, etc. It's true tariffs don't specifically target banks. The problem is that banks are part of the overall economy. Using customers' deposits to make investments is how they make money. The vast majority of NU's customers are in Brazil. Expansion in Columbia and Mexico would not be enough to keep it immune from the factors influencing the finances of most of its customers. || it's 25% down after a great ER.  
Although we had Buffet selling + some Brazilian political gibberish affecting it as well. || It already is the biggest bank in south america in valuation, and one of the biggest in terms of number of customers. It's also the biggest fintech outside of Asia.

It's also the biggest issuer of credit card, even with 100+MM customers, adding over 1MM per month.

It's not the biggest bank in Brazil only because there is a government owned bank that people are forced to be a customer for a number of reasons. || Itaú and Banco do Brasil are higher than they were in 2019’s high.

The main problem with their performance was not the bank itself, but higher interest rates that pushed valuations lower.

Itaú’s clients are of a higher networth on average and Banco do Brasil is heavily invested in agriculture, most of our farmers take credit only with Banco do Brasil.

Santander and Bradesco are a different story, a lot of delinquency rates and provisions for bad debt.

You are right about NU having fewer costs than Bradesco and other banks, but NU valuation is also way more expensive and with a more difficult and less obvious path for growth.

Nubank’s clients are the basis of the piramid here in Brazil, we commonly say it’s the bank of “interns and poor people”.

With that said, I think it’s a great business long term, but I think it may see a major decline in price next year.

INTR is way less expensive and is growing fast, I have them as my favourites. || It isn't influencing their decision because they're not competitors. 

It'd be like saying P66 is competing with EOG because they're both in oil and gas. Or Ferrari is a competitor to BYD. Or Walmart is a competitor to Gucci.

They're in the same broad industry but do not compete with each other because they have different target customers. || Not trying to wade into you guys' fight, but I am going to point out that he was quoting OP there. The statement is grayed out after a little line and the two numbers are his points pushing back on it. 

If you're on your phone or a third-party Reddit thing the formatting might not be coming through, but you guys actually are making a lot of the same points. || You said NU was going to be a rival to Citi in your initial comment. 

>You can have your opinion but learn how to read first.

You should read your own comment.

Also, why the hell do you think that Citi would be nervous about their rapid expansion in the US, if they're not competing with Citi? Is Citi worried about all companies who don't compete with them? I'd love to hear your logic for that lmao. || Also, correct me if I’m wrong. The 100% Tariff only gets emplaced if the BRICS nations create a new currency.

Is it just a foregone conclusion that BRICS will make a currency to compete with the U.S. dollar? || Yeah you’re right. I’m invested in them long term so I’m hoping that they’re able to expand out of Brazil more significantly. I think NU can overcome the tariffs and they will be okay in, at most, 4 years. Do you think the tariffs, and other financial concerns, in Brazil will affect the company long term? || Do you think NU will one day be used in all of the countries in South America? || Agreed, that's why I preferred to highlight in quotation marks what I was referring to in particular. || Show me where I said that Citi was going to be a rival to NU. 

I simply think people shouldn’t care what Citi has to say since it’s just an analysts opinion and they’re in the same industry.

I guess Citi’s rating isn’t a reason for their drop. I just assumed it was a reason, since the stock is commonly talked about on social media. I thought the stock was owned primarily by retail investors. || Argentina, Uruguay and Chile for sure, it's just a matter of time IMO.  
They even have a tech hub in Argentina and a entity in Uruguay. 

I wouldn't say all south America because we have shit countries like Venezuela || >Why do people care that Citi bank downgraded to a sell? **It’s literally a bank that could potentially have to rival NU soon if they break into USA markets.** Citi bank is just worried about a rapidly growing, amazing company.

There you go. || Good to know || How popular are their other products outside of banking? They don't actually get specific numbers in their earnings

For example with the cell phone carrier that just launched, do you think it's likely that gets strong traction? || Buddy… Do you not know what potentially means? Buy a dictionary or maybe ask AI for some help with english. || The other banking products besides credit cards are growing quickly, especially lending and investments.

As for NuCell, it's hard to say for sure since it was just launched. The pricing isn’t the most competitive, but the appeal lies in their excellent customer support. They're using incumbent infrastructure, so the signal and network quality won’t be better than what we already have. However, their customer service will stand out, and we Brazilians are fed up with the poor service provided by telecom companies—just like we were with banks before Nubank. Honestly, I don't think it's a moonshot though."
Is anyone else a little concerned about this market jump up?,"Listen, I get that it seems like clear skies and rainbows, and I’m not really a “bearish” type investor, but sometimes I find it good practice to sit back for a moment and just reevaluate the current situation we’re in.

I’ll give an example that pertains to me. I’m currently invested in Sofi, PLTR, and RKLB, so this has been an incredible year for me. But looking back, it’s starting to really feel like total and utter exuberance again like 2021. YouTube videos and subreddits have been saying over and over how this is only the beginning and we’re going to be at 500 next year. That’s exactly the type of shit that was said in 2021 right before every small cap stock tanked like 70%. 

I’m not saying it’s a time to sell, I would personally prescribe to the “it’s time to slow down on how much I invest” currently. Buying RKlb at 27$ or PLTR at 66$ is not the same opportunity as in the 4-7$ range as it used to be. It seems very difficult to find any good deals, considering literally almost every sector in the stock market is just going up vertically. And just remember, just it is a great company doesn’t always mean it’s currently a good price to buy it. Sometimes it’s good to take the foot off the breaks when stocks going up 300%+ in one year.

But hey what do I know. Just be careful out there folks, and don’t get sucked too hard into the FOMO. Be fearful when everyone else is greedy and all that jazz.",Glandryth,2024-12-01 23:54:14,524,458,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h49py3/is_anyone_else_a_little_concerned_about_this/,None,"Don’t listen to me I sold out of PLTR at 36$ because i thought it was getting overvalued || Agree w OP about the concern. feel like you can’t go wrong taking some profit.  I don’t understand the “all cash” mentality but think cash on hand will prove very useful.  Things like PLTR, in particular, seem very “toppy”- parabolic moves are often followed by big drops. || I'm reminded that when there was a bad drought in the Southwest that beef prices would get very expensive, so they shorted cattle futures and were.. crushed.  What happened was the drought caused people with cattle sent them to the slaughter house before the drought could kill them off.  

The people selling were right, but acted too soon.

I suspect that phenomena is happening now.  People assume Trump's tariffs will cause inflation, threats of trade war, counter threats etc.,  The kind of chaos that hurts the market.  Yet instead of the market going down, it's going up, because Trump's not president yet.  His policies are not yet unleashed and many businesses and the general public are stocking up now, in case.  

So, I'm slowly moving towards more cash position and may get some protective puts when the market starts slipping. || I’ve liquidated my tech stocks and have increased my cash position to 25% of my taxable portfolio.

Shiller P/E is very high right now and I’m actually expecting inflation to tick back up slightly and spook the markets. || I probably wouldn’t ask for advice on any of those three on Reddit. The Bulls will make claims that aren’t grounded in anything driven by actual financials while the Bears will act like the companies have no value at all. 

All I’ll say is in recent years I’ve had the luck to buy early into two companies that spiked incredibly, CELH & then TMDX. Both companies I made sells after seeing multiples returned on my investment, and both companies continued to go significantly higher than my sell basis. They continued to outperform, I regretted selling, not because it wasn’t the rational choice rather because of market movements. I should say they outperformed, until they didn’t, and both today sit below the selling points that I once had regrets about.

The market is funny in the short term and continued/linear outperformance of individual companies rarely happens over the medium term. || I expect a pullback, but there are still good opportunities in the market. I recently took some profits from NVDA and PLTR and quickly deployed that money into KLAC, ASML, MKSI, TER, and MPWR. || I feel the constant menace of tariffs is not being considered. 25% on Canadian lumber would basically cripple home construction (paired with loss of cheap labour with deportation). Now 100% tariffs on China goods?!?!? How can the music keep going? || You can follow the big boys, eg Warren Buffet

Lots of signs being there.  The best thing you can ever do with an investment is preserve capital.  The next best is to beat inflation. || Personally I have 30% in SGOV. But I’m also planning on retiring in a few years.

If the market crashes:

10% - I will rebalance to 80/20 - stock/SGOV

20% - I will rebalance to 90/10

30% - I will rebalance to 100% stock

I won’t be hunting the bottom (40-50% drop) but will start buying once it crashes 10% || Certain parts of the market are frothy because of the election and large cap tech/AI, now is the time to start finding the companies that are undervalued and leveraging AI to see better bottom lines and beat previous quarters. 

Large caps are most certainly at high valuations that are not sustainable to continue beating expectations, seeing this with NVDA and DELL most recently. 

Undervalued sectors on my radar are quantum computing and robotics. Emerging markets will benefit from decrease in interest rates (if that continues) and innovative technologies like I mentioned above will come to market faster with increased funding and the help of artificial intelligence tools at large.

Having fiat on hand to scoop up these positions is paramount. || I also stopped buying but not because of the market gains, the market is mostly always going up and that's exactly what we want. I'm waiting until end of January for Trump to settle in and see what changes, that's the only uncertainty I currently have. || I've been investing since the late 80s, and to me, this market feels ripe for a significant correction. I've upped my cash position to 25%, with everything else in broad index funds with a mind to DCA once a major correction happens. || No one knows when the corrections will come but diversity in a wide variety of the market is what I’m adjusting for.  December will be adjusting for taking gains, and moving to cash, January for taking a breather and DD on new tech and how AI is playing out for the majors and minors.  

I think it’s going to be a more cautious year for people like me.  I have solid ETFs for the bulk of my money, and I have a very diverse stock portfolio that is up 77 percent as of today, but that could change rapidly if irrational exuberance overtakes my conservative approach.  The signs are there that we’re a bloated tick, ready to pop. || I agree.  Look at all these meme coins rocketing up everyday.  This isn’t normal or rational.  At some point there will be massive payback, but we don’t know when. || Yep, PE Shiller is really high right now. || Ok, go buy bonds || It’s feeling like 2007. For you younger kiddos, 2008 wasn’t a surprise. There were a few people sounding the alarm but the market was blowing up post-dot.com boom and it was like a deer in the headlights. 

Is it the same today? The market hasn’t been rational in years so it’s much harder to gauge if/when the next crash happens esp. as the Trump administration steps in with more drastic policies in the ready eg tariffs, tax breaks, political policies etc. 

TLDR: who knows. || Not everything is frothy. Apple and Microsoft gains have been extremely conservative this year compared to the rest of the market. || Totally agree. 

We're so toppy.

Just look at all the gains in another sub.

Look at the Buffet moves.

Look at all the insider selling.

Look at stuff like PLTR... 60x earnings! || Time to selling near ATM covered calls || I'm lightening up on all of my stock investments. I'm mostly concerned about the major changes that will be happening once Trump takes office, and I don't think the market has even started digesting that yet. The pharma and food industries are in RFK's crosshairs, and the entire federal government is at risk for a major realignment and huge reductions in employees/contractors.

I also predict home prices are going to drop significantly in the counties surrounding Washington DC. || You know there are people from the 2008 crash that pulled out when the market started climbing in 2009, since it was to them just a “dead cat bounce” and they’ve been waiting for the right pull back for 15 years now…. || Buy more rocket lab || Signs are all around you - meme coins, buffet gdp ratio, layoffs, target weak earnings - of high valuations, retail euphoria and fundamentals getting weaker.

But that's just my best guess, I could miss out. || Very concerned. || You only feel like this because of what you hold and how long you have held it. The company’s you mention were depressed and didn’t do a lot under the rate raising inflationary market. Now rates are being lifted, inflation is easing and a new administration is coming in that’s likely to rollback regulations. Smart money is flowing back into growth, small caps etc… If you believe in what you’re holding, just hold. Worrying about if we’ve run too far and cutting your winners short, is a sure fire way to end up with mediocre gains. It’s early days for RKLB. Where do you think it will be in five years? 

Im guess what I’m saying is it’s a nuanced, big picture thing. Zoom out and look around you at what’s happening elsewhere. || Yes definitely a lot of exuberance and young guys posting their gains thinking they have cracked the code. I’d stay away from all the meme type wsb tickers and stick to good companies || The problem with going all cash or liquidating your position is - if you're wrong and the market continues to rise, you've no way of re-entering the market without accepting the opportunity cost. 

A good way to capitalize on your hunch is to hedge your bet. Perhaps buy a call whilst liquidating your position. Or set a stop loss so when the ball eventually falls, your position is liquidated automatically. || I’m so terrified but what can we do? I can move money to the sideline and miss out on big gains or just keep letting it run up and take my medicine when the correction comes. || Jesus Christ every fucking day with these posts. || I think everyone should follow the golden rule of not investing what you can't lose without it impacting your life. 

Although this AI boom is similar to the expansion of computers, Internet, cell phones, etc. A new gold rush.  There is an explosion of ingenuity happening and profits to be made. I don't see it slowing down anytime soon. || Lots of people were scared of Kamala being president. She ran on ""taxing unrealized gains"". Imagine being you with +$100,000 on positive growth in your account and then all of the sudden you get a tax bill for that. This had lots of people sitting on cash. Trump becoming president elect resulted in cash pouring into the market overnight resulting in a continuation of this ""rally"". || Yes, completely agree. In fact, the market currently feels so exuberant at the moment that I want nothing to do with it. I'm mostly on the sidelines in cash.

I know that it's irrational to pull out almost completely, but it just doesn't feel right to stay in. What's been going on at TSLA, MSTR, UMAC, DRUG, etc is too excessive. And playing along right now would feel like supporting the emerging oligarchy in a country I love. So I've come to terms with possibly missing out on a few % of upside over the next few weeks or months.

I will get back in with half of my cash if there is a smaller pullback in the course of the next two weeks, which seems likely to me, and even then I'll aim for global diversification. If no pullback happens, I will wait it out until Feb or Mar and reevaluate the situation then. || money is getting devalued, people realizing that the stock market is the reflection of our collective input (hence the name, stock), so by participating in the market everyone takes a share of their input in a momentum defined cash, and then we see a differences in collective skills of these companies, so even a slight advantage will multiply throughout, higher cash flow equals a greater growth trajectory, and as long as the product stays competitive people will keep bringing money, so it's up to the employees participating in it to make it worth something.

Back in 2021-2022, a lot of companies earnings were drastically dropping or slowing down. That’s why a lot of companies were selling off.

I'm just waiting for some of my top performing holdings to make it to 1 year, then I want to sell 50% and hold cash for an overall dip or a dip on some companies I like.

I have not and certainly do not anticipate selling a single share of either anytime on the foreseeable horizon, and my “solution” has been weekly DCA of small amounts (5 PLTR/10 RKLB).

I’m extremely thankful to have established my core positions in both companies when I did, but I also thought I’d have a lot more time to make bulk purchases.

PEs in general are ridiculous, and seem unsustainable, but that trend has been building for a while with a surprisingly long uptrend.

In times like this, I downshift from picking discounted good value stocks to buying indices and slowly expanding my cash reserves.

I have a vibe that the incoming administration will give some surprises to precipitate a panic crash on this overpriced market sooner or later, but I have anticipated many more crashes than reality has delivered, so in hindsight I'm glad I haven't acted aggressively to sell anytime my positions felt overvalued.

I know enough to know I personally can't anticipate what will happen in the markets to justify major portfolio pivots.

The thing that's been missing in this run is a new all time high by the Russell 2000 and it at least apparently finally came last week. It's stalled some after hitting on Monday, but I think something similar to 2021 is possible with it pushing hard into early next year and then topping out.

You invested in the right stocks and are mainly seeing growth. There are quite some stocks that haven't been performing well the past year and I agree some really seem overvalued.


Tesla almost soared 50% since Trump got reelected, while Trump wants to do less for the EV market. || The biggest difference from 2021 and now is that 2021 was the height of wfh(work from home) and low supply. It was also the tipping point when interest rates were hiked to combat inflation.

The whole market took a downturn because of the interest hikes but they've recovered since as interest rate cuts were getting on the table.

You are right to be skeptical. Not because there will be a natural correction but the catalyst for this correction is going to come from the stupidest president we've ever had in history. If you don't recall, the buffoon would swing the market in all directions every time he opened his mouth.

I sold my 500 shares @ $8 on Friday, before they were set to release Q3 earnings on the following Monday because I believed the stock price at $42 was overvalued.

This has been my biggest regret in investing throughout my time in the market. || Bought at $9, I sold at $27, right there with ya brother/sister! || I sold it at all 27.  But then again, I advised against eBay at $2, Amazon at $13 cuz they weren't gonna make any money.

I cant let go of the loss. I had 200 shares man. || It was and it is. || If inflation goes high, cash may not be the best holding.  But I don't know what will be the best other than having debt. || Yeah, I am concerned about a correction, but I wouldn't want to go all cash, just due to missing out on further gains. I am planning to move my more risky positions to consumer staples over the next couple days. I feel like reducing risk is still a grey area near timing the market, but not as equally but opposite risky as going all cash. || Cash is still paying almost 5%, so it's not a terrible time to sit on the sidelines for a while. || I trimmed most of my positions in stocks but still hold about 15%. This limits my overall risk || I agree.  I’m not looking at a full cash out, but I’m selling some shares of VOO from my various retirement accounts to get a bit cash balanced.  My portfolio was about 93% stock and 7% cash. 

I’ve sold about 15% so far into cash and may take things to a 60/40 split.  I also intend on stacking cash over the next 12 months and making my savings go straight cash instead of into equities.  

Sp500 is up like 28% this year.  Would be foolish to not expect a correction.  I’m not all doom and gloom so won’t sell everything, but i do want to take some profits and have some cash ready to buy the dip.  Since I’m selling within my IRA and 401k i don’t have to pay taxes unless i pull the money which I’m not. || Time in the market beats timing the market.

But having cash is not bad, just dont sell everything lol || I mean you really need to look at the tech stocks individually.

When it comes to the magnificent 7 I can agree on most of them being stupidly overvalued right now (especially NVDA, AAPL, & TSLA). I don't think that MSFT is insanely overvalued, but it's definitely pretty pricey right now. GOOGL on the other hand I think is still a great buy today given that it's trading for under a 20 forward PE ratio, and who knows how the monopoly trial stuff will even turn out at this point, it'll take years to fully play out. IMO it's got a good margin of safety right now. || So lame. We havent even started getting frothy in small caps || What do people mean by moving to cash? || My first job where I had a 401k was in the late '90s, when the stock market was going like gang busters.  I piled money into the stuff all the market gurus were extolling, only in time for the dotcom crash and subsequent recession.  Quite a lesson and made me more conservative in investments... until I realized I missed much of the market's recovery and growth, and finally piled in again when stock investing was all the rage and investment news media was all positive, excited about hitting new highs on top of interest rate cuts, and everyone and their cousin getting into retail investing.  I neglected the lesson I learned the previous time and was caught off guard like everyone else as things fell off a cliff.  At least this time I knew to not panic sell, and once things bottomed get fully invested.

I don't bother trying to time the market or predict when it'll peak.  But in hindsight the analysis shows how the market got ahead of itself.  Some tells are when bad news has no negative effect on the S&P, PE ratios are spiking but only insiders are selling, and various economic indicators are off yet the market seems to just shrug and power on up.  Sometimes retail investors are frothy over some new tech or new investment vehicle that is hard to understand, with stories of some ordinary guy(s) becoming an overnight billionaire.

It's almost funny how quickly and suddenly this turns into a panic, followed by doom and gloom as everyone's investments drop precipitously, and stories of a few overnight billionaires become replaced by stories of a lot of overnight paupers.  News media becomes dour and scolding of ill-informed investors, government figures wring hands, etc. etc.

Anyway, all this to say I personally am feeling deja vu big time.  No shortage of bad news out there yet the market ignores it and presses higher.  I love the stock discussions here on Reddit, but I get very similar vibes to the ""everyone's an investor"" vibes of past bubbles.  And there seem to not be a shortage of indicators flagging problem territory.

So, yes, this recent jump up I think is concerning, but more-so the general sentiment and behaviors feel like how it's felt at past peaks in the lead up to a sudden decline.

As it happens, I'm close enough to retirement to need to rebalance anyway, so I'm using it as an opportunity to significantly reduce my stock market exposure and start getting set more into income-generating investments like treasuries, MM, CDs.  Moving out of individual stock picks and into value mutual funds, and watching for funds overinvested in FAANG stocks.

For those not about to retire, I wouldn't say get out of the market but rather be more diligent about your investment choices.  Watch out for hype stocks, don't believe you know more than you think you do, diversify, don't be shy about taking your profits, and really contemplate how your gut would feel if a third of your investment disappeared over a few days - if you suspect that might make you sell, you might want to rethink about reducing your risk levels. || This is the right approach, there is nothing wrong with taking profit after something goes up 4x in a relatively short span of time. Sometimes companies valuations get so steep they greatly exceed any short or medium term fundamentals and it can take a few years for those to catch up to the price. Such is probably the case for PLTR, although ultimately it may go higher, but it probably wont 4x from here for 5-10 years. Valuations can get stupid though. Maybe PLTR does another 4x in 2025, im not saying thats completely outside the realm of possibility. But there are other opportunities out there with a higher margin of safety. For example, I think Reddit has a good chance to do another 2x over the next 12 months. || ASML is looking mighty fine right now || Yes ASML especially with their new 1nm fabrication unit! || bro I just found MPWR !!

Nothing wrong with taking some gains and moving it to something a bit safer.  There will be a dip at some point and it’s always good to have some dry powder.

When enough people panic and sell, that is what causes the crash. || Do you think wmt stock will dip anytime soon ? || Like you, I like Quantum Computing...although I believe that the real growth in this field are 3-5 years out. || Remember when Japans interest rates dropped US stocks hard a few months back ...and brokers stopped retail buying ..during the biggest stock sell off of probably a decade ..but institutional investors were not locked out?   

100% evidence of how the system is manipulated to fuck over the retail investors.  

Why is there not an investigation into the retail lock out? || Ah yes ‘just’ use a subjective valuation scale to make moves. That’s never burned anyone. || If the market corrects, everything will correct regardless of their value || I am with you. This growth seems unjustified. I am starting to see earning reports that are disappointing Wall Street along with a 26% unemployment for Tech Workers. I am perplexed to see the Market grow everyday with so many red flags. || Agree. || Yup. People are so irrational. It’s why most would be better suited with a money manager. || For 12 months? || Ho Ho Ho || Those are growth companies. P/E alone is a terrible measure without looking into the company and what’s coming. || They really need to be quoting more like late 2021 through a lot of 2022, but what happened then was very nasty and arguably wasn’t viewable in the indexes (could in the Nasdaq some, but even there it didn’t do it justice).

You can relate it back to Covid some, but it was more like the interest rate/inflation hysteria. || apple, walmart, costco all at 40 fwd p/e's+! || It’s called a bull market not overbought. You will be figuring and missing out. || This year is only 4 weeks...    I think 2nd week in January will be telling. || This year? Within a month? What’s the catalyst || This is my thought as well. || Yes I agree. Cut your winners short. Never let them keep riding. /s || Space industry is projected to hit 1T in 5 years. RKLB by today’s standards is THE investing stock. || RKLB is 💯 an investing stock and you have no clue what you’re talking about. It’s ok, RKLB just isn’t the one for you. Invest in what you understand because it clearly isn’t RKLB. || Mid December is next week || [deleted] || U mad bro? || 😭 || Being cautious is zero financial knowledge, sure... || That’s it man || Yeah but he purchased at IPO price about $36 😂🤣 JK JK || Well i bought at 5.99 and sold at 15 so yeah… || Exact same situation with me. Sold at $40 with average cost of $15.50. But profits not realized was never my money anyway. 😮‍💨 || You are my twin || Bubbles buy Yacht's :) || Last words of a man about to lose everything || Right. Just ask the tech investors from 2001. || This is the correct take. Like, why exit your entire position all at once. Make a strategic, tiered exit || 8 to 42 is fucking amazing, should not feel too much regret || I get the feeling traders are trying to push it to 69 because you know that’s shit they do but i can’t see it holding this valuation || I’d say that was a smart move. These growth stocks are gambling at this point. || >This has been my biggest regret in investing throughout my time in the market.

I started buying AMD at $11 because I realized Zen would take huge chunks out of Intel's market. I sold around $20-24~

That said I have made a lot of money from them anyway by buying/selling at different levels and I expect to keep making more from them

Good knowledge in a specific market is a gold mine. || This isn't always the case. Both Nvidia and Zscaler dropped a lot while they both beat expectations. || This is almost exactly what I did. I said 30? Not a chance. || It’ll be back there eventually don’t worry lol

I bought at 14 sold at 29. Even 29 was ridiculously priced. 60+ makes no sense || I sold 90% of my holdings as well and of course it's continued to go up since then. 😖 || Right now?  Silver and gold are slightly inflated.  Gold is down a little bit, but I think if the dollar gets stronger it will approach closer to $2500.  Silver at 30 is risky.  I have prior silver purchases that I'm holding.  I might buy more if this drops to 25.

Platinum and Palladium are actually great value right now.  Platinum has bounced between 800-1200 the past few years and offers solid value around 950-1000 right now.  Palladium is a little more volatile right now since Russia is a large miner of it.  Also some loosening demand with auto industry moving towards EV's.

If I had to choose to anchor my portfolio I would probably hold Platinum right now. || TBH, I don’t know that consumer staples are much “safer”. Traditionally sure, but if excessive valuation is the concern, are they now? Costco trades at 58x earnings, P&G 31, Walmart 38. These three account for over 30% of XLP, the consumer staples sector. You can go down the list and find less preposterous valuations of course but still, sky high across the board. || Serious question: If you don't take the profit, and I assume are unlikely to any time soon, then how are you missing out on profit? At these levels it seems like you're only going to miss a large drop that falls away below where we are now. Whether that takes 1 year or 3. || What broker are you using? || Is this through a high yield savings account? || It also limits potential gains for the next cycle up. If the correction doesn’t occur for another 6-12 months and the correction is small??? Those gains could very well be larger than any subsequent declines. || MSfT is up almost doubly since they’ve been doubling down on AI bullshit in 2023, so yeah they are overpriced AF as well as || GOOGL is dead and doesn't know it yet.

AI has killed search forever. I worked 10 years in search, it's dead. Now all that remains is for people to realize. || Take the free 4% gains in money market rather than risking losses in equities || Solid advice here. Thanks for sharing your experiences. || I have parked cash in bonds, preferreds and some money market ETFs. It would be a miracle if there's not at least a correction or two by June next year. || Down 24% in 3 months ? || Curious of what you think of investing in leveraged long semiconductor like SOXW? I would say now is the time to buy them up and then attach a 3% trailing stop loss after buying. If semiconductor stocks sink another 10% then repeat this and you will eventually catch the bottom and make money when ASML and other semiconductor companies rebound. || Also considering jumpin in || Yes friend! We should all do the needful and purchase wonderful company MPWR! || Sell the news, buy the rumor. || I’m not saying anyone here knows better than Warren Buffet but look at his holdings right now, not exactly positioned for high growth. || RemindMe! 1 year || Look for an EFT, like IQM. 

Even IGM for expanded exposure to tech without having to pick single winners. || Kernel Holding will go up if the war ends in a way that is any way favourable for Ukraine || waiting to buy the dip is what made me lose the best opportunities.
DCA all the way || I don’t follow || You are delusional my friend, specific stocks go up 100% every month, did you buy those specific stocks?

I am fine with waiting until I'm satisfied with macroeconomic outlook, I don't have FOMO.

I don't think you understand the concept of Risk adjusted returns. || Is it timing the market to wait out uncertain times? I thought timing the market was trying to buy at low points and sell high at points? || Tariffs and counter tariffs (trade wars), inflation flare up, higher unemployment, slow AI adoption, higher for longer interest rates, labour market shortage esp. on the low skill end (agriculture). Pick your poison.
Less likely catalysts but not impossible: Middle East conflict (Iran, Strait of Hormuz) impacts oil supply or Suez canal, Taiwan (embargo?), North Korea/South Korea, banking or financial crisis, a major natural disaster impacting supply chains...

Apart from a correction one scenario no one is discussing but not so unlikely is a range-bound sideways market where earnings slowly grow and prices are stagnant, to get P/E back to more reasonable levels. S&P500 and/or DOW ends 2025 just +/-5%. || Ouch!  I’m glad you’re alive and still investing! || Not true. The U.S. Federal Reserve has been reducing the money supply over the last two years. This reduction is primarily due to the Fed shrinking its balance sheet and rising interest rates, which have led to a decline in savings deposits and a decrease in the M2 money supply by about $700 billion since the rate hiking cycle began. The Fed's balance sheet has been reduced by approximately $800 billion, as it stopped reinvesting maturing securities, contributing to this contraction in money supply. || Gonna save this comment for 6 months later || You sound afraid of missing out || I've been thinking the same for a while now.

The world is changing so fast on so many levels, out with the old in with the new. As an example, who would have thought that people would rather get their daily news from You tubers and turn their back on mainstream media? Mainstream media is going the way of the newspaper.  The market Warren B has known so well has never had the worlds richest companies in a (AI) race throwing billions and billions of dollars at winning that race..

The world is gearing up for a new world order with AI ..and the market is buzzing for it.

This is where I think OG Wazza's (Warren Buffet) tried and tested ways are becoming out of touch with where the big big money is currently to be had.    Shit, he's done phenomenal at keeping up with modern markets compared to the the generation he grew up in,  he's nearly a hundred and its amazing he's still doing so well, but yeah.. I think his legacy teaches us a lot, but were most likely at a point where we should no longer follow his actions verbatim.  
A teacher to learn from and grow from but not to duplicate his exact actions. || Yeah fundamentals have gone out the window for years. The fact that GME still has value is enough to validate this so “who knows” rings true till someone way above our pay grade decides to pull the rug. || I prefer a mix. But usually start with shorter term OTM calls from weeks to a month out from expiration. If the stock moves against you higher you can roll position to extend expiration further into future.

The longer away the expiration, the more the call acts like shorting the stock - less theta decay but you profit from big moves downward. But usually if you start with longer term expirations - why not just close your long position to begin with? Usually people do this is they are trying to avoid paying capital gains and want to hold the stock long-term even through a market correction. || What if you ""locked in those gains"" that amounted to a sizeable portion of your portfolio, say 30%, then the market continued to rally with no substantial pull back for the next say 3-4 years? Or you could just be invested in the market for a long term play.

  
""locking in gains"" is timing the market. If you're going to want to do this in any meaningful way, you'd likely be talking a sizeable portion of your portfolio say 30%+, to try and catch a peak sell then a bottom buy in...  If you're only talking about locking in small amount of gains say 5% of your portfolio, then you may as well keep it in the marketlol.. || I have extremely strong genes. Very high brain. A hugely good brain. || I don't consider myself obscenely wealthy and I transferred cash to moment Trump became president elect || Congrats! Make sure to sell before the inevitable dump. || You can toss fundamentals in the dumpster and burn that dumpster on Tesla until you see the most likely inevitable fallout between Elon and Trump due to them both having a strong case of main character syndrome.

The only thing that's going to halt Tesla from seeing $500+ next year is if we see the Nasdaq itself get hammered (and if so, it'll probably not get hit as hard as it was in 2022). || because the valuation is a collective measure of future outcomes, markets are more open these days especially in the US, and people are more optimistic by nature, and so far there's no limit on future growth of tesla since Musk proved that he is a hardware Midas. Tesla can extended in any segment or a vertical of the market and they're executing. The only risk would be other competition but there's no sight and Tesla likely vacuumed all the talent on the market. I don't touch it as this seems too optimistic but welp, I keep not making money from tsla, long dated calls it is. Plus there's a whole planet that needs to stop smoking the air || Maybe in the short term w/ tariffs? They'd be paying it first before passing it on to the consumer, so I'd expect a dip. || Any companies you like in that space? || I absolutely remember, and that's just one example.

Retail is systematically locked out or manipulated at pretty much every level of the stock market.  I've gotten better at filtering out the noise, but there's a lot of it and there's no way that any retail investor could ever make up the information gap.  All you can do is try to guess right as to what the powers-that-be will eventually do in regards to the finance industry. || 26% unemployment for tech workers is a drop in the Ocean compared to when AI is fully up and running and screaming along.   If I was in Tech, I would be looking for a new career ..one that AI can't take from me.  No better time to be a plumber :) || I'm not sure where you get your data but you might want to unsubscribe. Only COST, among those 3, is at 40+ fpe. || I have most my money in bitcoin right now, not missing out on anything. I’ve been buying better stuff for my house, kids, and myself. I’ve been looking at some stuff in the AI space, ASML and AMD.

What are you buying or looking at? I really only know bitcoin and tech companies. || Let them. People are silly 😂 || I said trim. 
Not sell entire position.

Your statement doesn't make logical sense. I never implied to never let winners keep riding. Trimming 10% of position means you let 90% keep riding.

Greed kills

If we all could predict the future (which we cant), then it's easy to say that winners will keep winning or running.

Here's a prime example. I was up 550% on lunr last Jan. Bought around 2.5. It ran up to 14 or so. I sold around 12. Had I held and hoped it would just keep running (future is so easy to predict /s), I'd watch it plunge from 14 back to 3s.

Risk management is a thing.

And please don't respond with...
""Why you taking this so personally"" or something of the like. || I would agree a small portion of your investment plan could include RKLB, just as a portion of my plan includes OKLO because I believe in nuclear, but it’s going to be a stock with a lot of volatility and if you are expecting any type of pull back, it’s one one the ones that’s gonna be hit hard in the short term.  || I hold shares too and I'm not adding at a price to sales of 35. That's just stupid. RKLB is a meme stock and has been since a meme stock since August. If you look into a WSB daily chat, RKLB is high up there. || Considering it shows up on r/wallstreet bets 100 times per week means it’s still a trading stock and expect volatility.  || RemindMe! 3 months || How do you feel about your 11% drop today?  You may want to reconsider what you think a safe investment is.  || I bought at 27, 17, 10 , 9 , 7 and still holding 2200 shares || I feel like I have a knack for finding these gems early. Unfortunately I get bored easy and leave before all the excitement happens. || [removed] || Reporting for duty! || yachts. || ""I 6x-ed my stock, but I'm mad I didn't 8x it""

FOH || I mean, standard TA indicates a pullback at around 69. Or a pull out || This is what I’ve been trying to tell myself ever since Trump got elected because it breaks me that I sold all 550 of my shares around 26$ (avg was 17$) Nope, just keeps going up. || Well, I was figuring they will do better in a high-inflationary period, and they have a lower beta. What would you suggest if trying to thread the needle between volatility and cash equivalents? || Well, for one thing, it depends on your circumstances. I am retired, so I am not adding to my position. It's easier for someone not needing the money for 5-10 years to be able to ignore volatility.

That aside, there is always profit to be missed on any given day depending how complete your information is. If I can cash out, and it drops 10% and then I cash back in.. I made 10% ish of my money. Obviously, we can't predict the future, though. But everyone is always missing out on potential profit every day, because nobody's prediction skills are 100% (and most are way way way less).

I don't quite understand the second part of your question, but hopefully the answer I gave is general enough that my take is still relevant. || Vanguard || I use VMFXX (Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund) to hold all non-invested cash. It's currently paying 4.57%. || Either a HYSA or a money market fund like SPAXX || Could be....
I'm up 98% over the past year, which is good enough for me. I was 100% invested in small caps and micro caps. None of it in s&p. So far riskier.

Put most of my profits in savings account. If market keeps going up, I'll likely keep making profits on my remaining positions. I'd rather not have ALL my money in the market bc I need a cushion to pay taxes and other bills. Lol.

I also prefer trimming a proportion of my positions at a key target level. That way, I won't miss out on further gains. The amount I'll trim is related to how risky I think the position is at current price.

 I'm more of a swing trader than an investor anyway. I do keep longer-term positions in retirement acct and don't really look at it....just let it sit and forget about it. || Could be small could also be over 20% like early 2022 who knows || Data to support your argument? || What is money market? || I already sold everything :( || And that’s the capital preservation aspect in a real world example. || Most of us know the technology sector better than Buffett, and that isn't a bold statement.

He has ignored the biggest driver of wealth for thirtyish years now. || Just buy and hold for 90 fucking years. || He’s smart raising cash at high valuations 
He will probably be bailing out some large companies when the market is crashing in 6-18 months 
Monday will see some action I believe because Trump is go to use Tarriffs to control the world

|-|-|-|-| || So unlikely. || Did I not specifically say that it depends on the stock? Yes I’m tapped into hype stocks. And have realized the returns I mentioned. 

If you have a low risk tolerance, fine. But don’t denigrate my strategy by calling me delusional. 

Nothing I said was wrong or untrue. Have fun with your meager returns. || That’s the definition of timing the market || Thanks! It wasn't so bad actually, just two weeks on the couch taking antibiotics. Tick-borne encephalitis could have been much more dangerous. || Its just whenever theres a serious dip like 2020 they print like crazy… not even shutting down the economy could stop this market || You’re the one who is missing out my friend. I’m sure you’re the same guy who was skeptical of bitcoin. If you dollar cost averaged $100 a month since 2017 Bitcoin , you would have amassed close to $150k. Even more if you started earlier || The signals are always strong until they are not. || OP is talking about moving from highly speculative plays which should never be a full port of your portfolio.

To someone like that putting 30% or more of their portfolio into spy is pulling back but still getting market gains.  And if the market dumps 10% they’re happy that spy only went down 10% so they can put it into the next speculative thing that’s down 90% or hasn’t even popped off yet. || Then you don't know what her plan was. Only people with a net worth over $100 million would have their unrealized gains taxed. A better question is what are your plans once tariffs cause widespread consumer demand to plummet? || [deleted] || D Wave is one to watch. Of course IBM and Microsoft are investing heavily into the space. || all those 3 companies are still trading at multi-decade high forward p/e's || Bulls win, bears win, pigs get slaughtered. || Lol, it’s anything but. Just because it’s discussed on WSB doesn’t mean anything. They talk about it all. Do some research before you take a position. Or don’t… your loss. 🤷‍♀️ || It means it’s growing in popularity, for good reason. || I don’t really know anything about TA honestly,  I just know how these regards think. || I don’t have an answer for that because I’m not trying to thread any needles. I don’t buy what seems like a bad investment just because I feel like I need to be in the market. || I suppose my question is, the s&p is currently at 6000. Is there much chance it won't see 5400 in the next couple of years? 

If you're in ETFs, even for the long haul, it feels worth it to close your positions and wait for the next big drop to buy more. || 4.57% is not 5% || Naturally ALL one’s money should not be in the market. Money is needed to pay bills like taxes plus an emergency fund preferably in a HYSA. || Just Google about Sundar Pichai and his enshittification of the product. I never use Google anymore, it's completely useless after AI. It's a dead product, it's the next Yahoo, AI is infinitely superior to googling.

Maybe Google can get going with their AI or some other stuff, but history doesn't prove it, they've tried a ton of things and failed at all that isn't search. || Risk free rate || He didn't ignore AAPL. || in the next 6-18 months we could see gains that are greater than the subsequent correction. 🤷‍♂️ || You guys having been saying this same shit for 6 years now || LMAO || The saddest and truest comment in the thread. || Oookaaaay.... || My understanding of their post was the market in general. 

They then used trendy stocks as an example to illustrate the frothy market. 

I did not interpret their wording as they are specially asking about trendy meme stocks are looking frothy and they should   Lock in some gains. I interpreted it as they were asking about the US market in general. 

I’m a doctor btw. So pretty smart right. I’m sure my interpretation of what they wrote is the correct version. || I dunno about that. But it just doesn't make sense for a company that was worth $2 a month ago to be worth $20 now, even under the assumption that they're going to be on the receiving end of the Trumps' cronyism. They'd need to scale up operations substantially to be worth that much, and there's no guarantee that they'd be successful in that.

As far as I understand, price started surging about a month ago due to insider buys, who must already have known that this news would come. I imagine them partly cashing out these days. || Moving the goalposts are we  || Same thing was said back in 2021 at a similar valuation and then it corrected 80 odd porcent || Eh i just wanted to say they'd pull out at 69

The TA angle is true though. But TA and psychological levels are kind of interlinked so it probably is because of what you're saying || By this, you mean you don't mind being in cash, and/or you aren't concerned about the possibility of the country moving to high inflation? || I see. I think it's possible it goes from 6000 to 5400.. But I also think it's possible that, instead, it goes up to 7000 first, and then drops to 6400, and I've lost 400 by staying out until then. And even if it does go to 5400 in a couple years, that's a long time to be out of the market and worried that it may never drop back to where it is now. The market gradually goes up, so it's a better default position to be in than out. || Oh we could easily see 4750 again. We could also see 7500 before we see 4750. Or we may see 5000 and then have a 2000-2010 sideways market. Or none of those things could happen and we see 10000 before falling back to 7500. 

Well diversified properly allocated portfolio which we keep rebalancing is all we can do… and taking doubles and triples off the board when the next swing is a home run - that’s okay. || I saw an analyst saying that they have modelled for the s&p to go to 15k because of millennials and zoomers powering the market as opposed to gen X which is a smaller gen. This was on the scaramucci show. He also said btc 250 this time next year || Keep in mind It’s an election year. Fed has pivoted 🤷 || True. It was all my prev savings. I still had enough to cover the basics but my bags were a bit too heavy. Lol. || Wait, Google about it? || Alphabet is also YouTube, they are ruining that one with ads, I rarely watch it without ad filters but it's still highly popular. They also own Waymo, the only really self-driving company I take serious. Search is partially dead and Gemini is inferior right now, although guess what Perplexity is running on? Google still has great offerings with Maps and Mail, their App store isn't losing money, the whole Chromebook/Android/Pixel business is baking money, they have whatever is left of Fitbit and Nest, just to name a few. There's a lot of potential based on some strong income streams. || Wow. I’m completely uninformed. I know what none of this means. Time to do some learning.

edit: typo || Buffett (as I think he has stated many times) evaluated Apple as an appliance/widget seller that happens to vertically integrate its tech into its products, not a ""technology company."" Said another way, Apple's primary business is selling products that have tech, not selling tech that works on other company's products.

I agree with that analysis, and I would note that it's an insanely shrewd observation on his part. || One of Buffets Analysts got him into Apple lol, it wasn’t even him.
He is a GOAT but he has been totally blind to tech there’s no denying that || Winning--Bigly is a very smart guy. One of the smartest guys I know! || yeah my bad, just flagging that these are still historically high P/Es for these companies. they haven't had the earnings growth || What else was happening during that period in the market? I’m curious. It’s almost as if inflation drove the fed to raise rates which created a market wide sell off. The hardest hit of which were the growth and small caps. That left a major buying opportunity for anyone paying attention (it wasn’t you). Now the company is on track to launch the equivalent of a Falcon9 next summer, at a pace faster than anyone else has ever done. Oh and they’ve done this for between 2-300 million. 

Continue telling me more about how you haven’t spent a second researching the company. You clearly saw a post someone half intelligent made and decided to follow. Lucky for you, you made some money. This time. || Right. This is exactly on point. It’s guess work. From 2014-201 I remember lots of people were amassing cash waiting for another crash which never came. If the SP500 goes up to 7000 then it drops down to 6400. People will be reluctant to get back in until it drops back to 6000 (break-even). If they keep waiting until a return to 6000 it could V-shape recover back to 7000 or even 7500. Then the real suffering would be felt. The most valuable service provided by advisors is not stock picking, it’s psychological, staying cool and not acting on fear or greed. Stay invested (if not 100% then within your comfort level, maybe 60-70%), ride out a correction, ride up the recovery. || Yea it's almost as if people say time in the market is the best thing, ya know because it's true || Ok you make a good point. I probably could have said the same at 5. || join the ponzi, but hover your finger over the sell button.

and sleep with one eye open || Yeah, and be prepared to weigh through the first 10 results of promoted bullshit content, and AI generated cruft to find out there 0 results that match your search || Yes, ok, let me explain it so ingrates on reddit won't downvote me despite me being a literal 10 years (actually 15) industry expert.

This kind of search is called a navigational search, it's the only thing Google is useful for now. It's called navigational, because you know what you are looking for, but don't know where it is. It's basically a directory lookup.

You could of course just ask ChatGPT to find it for you, but it would be slightly slower.

However, I could also jusk ask Claude to summarize it for me:

**Prompt:** ""Summarize the articles about Sundar Pichai enshittifying Google""

**Answer:**

I am still a fan of reddit for communities like this, but if Musk gets his shit together to create a better group alternative, it could dig into Reddit quite a bit.

Also RDDT went up due to Google training their AI on it, but Google seems unlikely to win the AI game unless they buy Claude or Mistral which they should."

Auto giant Stellantis announces ""immediate"" resignation of CEO Tavares

Sunday, December 01, 2024 09:03 pm
Dec. 1 (AFP) -- Stellantis chief executive Carlos Tavares on Sunday resigned ""with immediate effect"", the auto giant announced, signalling differences over the future of the multi-brand firm.
The company, which makes Fiat, Peugeot and Jeep vehicles, said in a statement that the board had accepted the resignation of the 66-year-old Portuguese executive. ""In recent weeks different views have emerged which have resulted in the board and the CEO coming to today's decision,"" independent director Henri de Castries said in the statement.",Far_Sentence_5036,2024-12-02 01:44:56,238,98,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h4ccah/stellantis_ceo_resignes_is_fired/,None,"I'm an engineer for Stellantis, and this year has been one of the worst. Not looking good at all. We keep taking shortcuts attempting to save money, you'll soon see with the plastic we went with for the 2025 models lmfao || Shouldn’t the stock go up if the general sentiment is that leadership is handicapping the company’s growth and wellbeing? That’s what happened with Starbucks || this is going to be a wild ride. European/American automakers are in big trouble. || Maybe they can raise the keep prices even more in celebration. || Took way to long.

The Hornet was a horrible idea.

A basic RAM contractor truck is 50k+ || 80k jeeps for everyone || Candidate for worst auto exec of all time, which is quite the achievement || Stellantis has provided better returns to the long term buy-and-hold investor over the past decade than either Ford or GM, especially once you factor in the Ferrari spinoff. || Increased prices so much, he tanked sales of jeep,Ram and  dodge. No reasonable person is going to spend 100k on a jeep or ram truck with the unreliability of them || how many millions does he get for leaving and running this company even further into the ground? || did he resign? or was he fired? WHICH IS IT || Make cars people can afford to buy and are easy to work on. Problem solved. || No one wants to buy any Stellantis products. You have to be stupid to buy any new Dodge/RAM/Jeep product when there are other options out there that won't explode on you. 

Their only lifeline are the RAM trucks, which are actually good, just expensive. They killed the Challenger/Charger crowd by getting rid of the v8 and no one wants to pay $60-70k for a Jeep Wrangler. || Hallefuckinglujah

I own two Dodge cars.  I used to love their philosophy.  But they have lost their fucking minds. || No surprise. Demand for automobiles has been getting weaker. Weak businesses in autos are having trouble. || If the board that hired him are still there, then nothing was solved. Its the same people and they will pick another imbecile. || Everyone buy puts so the market makers send it to the moon and save my bag holding ass! || I wouldn’t buy a Chrysler/Fiat product if you were paying, definitely not interested in owning a piece of that company. || US brand? At least 30% of their cars come from Mexico. Maybe that tariiff scared him off. || Cars are a multi faceted business. Ultimately the goal is to sell a ton of cars in order to sell a bunch of parts. The more cars you sell the more your dealers return to you in service/collision parts purchases. This means you don’t want to sell the perfect car that never breaks and if you do, you dont sell many. You want to sell a lot of cars that exceptionally fit what most people desire in the segment, and can potentially be involved in car accidents 😉. And you never want people to hate it right away. But you can’t expect a manufacturer to not want part failures. There are rules for how long you have to support a vehicle you sell with repair parts. This means you have to make stuff you don’t need at the moment and hope you nailed it in the first place it or can keep up with what comes up. No one wants to have stuff they can’t sell cause no one needs or wants it. 

The company is in rough shape no doubt. Did you know that front brake pads and rotors for a hellcat cost $4800 in parts alone at retail. Most fiat based platforms will make your bank account like WSB loss porn just to stay running.  

They need to axe like 50% of what they have going on and they have committed to an electric direction no one else is following recently or now, especially after trumps election. || Shares down?

Make JEEP american again! || People blaming him have no idea what they're talking about

Stellantis was/is in a lot of trouble and this guy was someone who could enact change || It's one of the best CEOs in the world, let alone automotive.


Call it what you want but he wanted out for months due to the board not supporting him. 


Now they have a bigger problem in their hands.


Where talking about a guy that has nothing else to prove and more money he ever dreamed. 


He just wasn't taking bullshit any longer. 


The US dealership model needed to be destroyed and the prices where exactly what he was against... Notice the wagoneer being the cheaper SUV in its range... 


He was fighting for cheaper, not the other way around.  || Just like Nissan, maybe they only have a few years left to live. This is because of Tesla. They’re destroying every company right now and their company is needs to be divested into multiple companies. It’s going to take over unfortunately || Ripe for a trump appointment || Thanks for the info! exactly why i love reddit

Tavares had a great Aura with investors but in reality he gutted the company to goose near term earnings and pay himself a 30m bonus last year || It's not your fault, but Stellantis vehicles have been unreliable, cheap junk long before 2025. || Oof, that plastic switch is gonna come back to bite them hard when customer reviews start dropping. As a potential buyer this is good to know - guess I'll avoid the '25 models like the plague. Stay strong man, corporate penny pinching always ends badly || If Stellnatis made helicopters they would make the Jesus nut out of plastic to save $2. 

Why are the bumpers on jeeps so cheaply made. || Stellantis tech here. What changed and is it going to break on me more often? || Been eyeing the Peugeot 408. Please tell me if I am making a mistake… || I would be very, very careful. Many people are thinking what you are thinking, which may inflate the price a little in the next days, but I think (this is not my job, this is just my opinion) that we are just another bad news away from crashing vertically even more.

I would only invest what you can afford to lose without swearing too much || Starbucks stock went up because they picked Nichols as the CEO  - Stellantis has not picked anyone yet || Lets see who they pick as a replacement..

Tavares did have some credibility - so my take is that situation is much worse than anticipated on the ground

but maybe the market is already pricing that in and change of CEO is positive news || Stellantis has a very bad reputation because of the puretech motors here in France || You can't fix manufacturing issues fast like you can coffee. || Isn't Stellantis backing ACHR? || Adds to further and wider variability of outcomes || Not with a company like this which is going out of business. || And what we think will happen with Google. Think.  || Throw in Japanese if you take in account for Nissan || Yeah the Chinese are going to come in guns blazing and take more of their market share || Japanese are bad too. China dominates the EV market and it’s not even close || Or make another 800 horsepower Charger instead of trying to make a modern day K-car success happen. || The Hornet is dumb, but it's also just a rebadged [Alfa Romeo Tonale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfa_Romeo_Tonale), so it doesn't need to be good. It was a very low-effort offering for Stellantis to throw into the market. || That spin off was soooo sweet || 100m || Yes. || decided to pursue other career opportunities. we wish them well. || not clear in the post, i think he might have resigned (in other words, might have been fired) || A wrangler that may catch on fire in your garage at that || It is INSANE that you can get a Cummins diesel 2500 for the same price range as a Jeep. || If that's their lifeline, it's not tied to anything solid. American trucks, in terms of quality and value.

Ford > GM > RAM 

A plow guy who buys a RAM is a guy struggling financially getting his front end rebuilt at least once a season. || You're nuts.  The Challenger and Charger have been stellar vehicles for the money for years.

And Tavares gutted their legacy. || I don't see what this has to do with Tesla. More like their brands have been shitty unreliable vehicles for many years, they price gouged during COVID, stopped making any affordable vehicles, massively overproduced a supply, and now nobody wants to buy the overpriced crap. || You're right on that. It's unfortunate because a lot of us have great ideas and could truly make these cars amazing, but the big guys just want the customers to be happy with as little spending possible. 

Happy to help! GM has had a great year || Now unreliable EXPENSIVE junk! || I don't want to get too specific as it wouldn't be too too difficult to find me lol, but mainly referring to the interior plastics. You'll notice that the materials are brittle as fuck, if they need to be removed for repairing there is a high chance the component will break. Also makes them money by having customers purchase new trim pieces etc... || i sold my starbucks cuz of that and i didn't beleive in the company anymore..the stock is still flying-.-; but i am still happy i sold tho. || Tavares spent too much time on his Portugal ranch instead of running the business

the dude got paid like $30m last year || Yes, [over $150M](https://www.stellantis.com/en/news/press-releases/2024/july/stellantis-invests-additional-55-million-in-archer-following-recent-flight-test-milestone) the last couple of years, not counting the stock they bought on the public market. || For real. Nissan is one of the few auto companies that has a junk credit rating, and they've had a ton of other problems for a while. Stellantis despite all their problems people are mentioning here has a much higher profit margin than Nissan (which is barely profitable at all). || I feel bad for Nissan. They ate a lot of shit for their unreliable CVTs in the early 10's but modern ones are perfectly fine. But they still only sell their cars to people with double digit credit scores. || Japanese automakers are largely doing better than just about everyone else. It's Nissan going through struggles, that's about it. Toyota and Honda need to nail it on EVs for the 2026-2027 timeline, but that's about it, and they've been quietly working towards that mark for a while with Toyota's Arene and Area 35 projects, and Honda's Zero and Afeela projects. They'll get there. || I think investors and the media overall may have underestimated Sergio Marchionne as CEO. || Real knife fight out there  || Tesla makes the dealership problems worse though when they (and other EV startups) show how great cutting out the middle man and ordering a car online can be.

I have zero social skills and I suck at negotiating, so I have no interest in ever buying another vehicle from a dealership now that there's other options available. || Lol I hope companies who take shortcuts by taking the cheap way (especially cutting off employees) will fucking bleed. Of course megacaps are immuned lol || More so than usual? I have a GM car and I only broke (1) trim piece replacing the radio. The average is \~3. The center speaker cover alone had FIVE clips holding in (essentially) a piece of plastic the size of a grapefruit.

I tend to put a very small amount of grease on the clips before I reinstall any trim pieces...

If you have any say in the automotive industry... why do the volume knobs on radios consistently go bad? I've had it happen on Ford, Volvo, Chevy... almost doesn't matter the brand lol || >I feel bad for Nissan. 


You should feel bad for all the customers they f'ed over the years.


>They ate a lot of shit for their unreliable CVTs 


They didn't eat enough. Pretty much had the worst CVTs on the market, they should have gone bankrupt.



>but modern ones are perfectly fine.



no they arent. theyre better, but still inferior quality. || Even if you have enough cash to buy outright? USA credit culture is so odd to me || We had a 03’ Maxima…it was basically junk at 70k miles….never again || >I have zero social skills

Clearly, you're on Reddit lol || Credit score is irrelevant if you’re paying cash. Only a factor when borrowing money. || It was weirder, yet.  Wasn't that long ago that a guy who can't pay off his 60K car loans can also get another loan for a 500K house. || Cash matters.  You don’t get certain “discounts” with cash. 

I could have bought my Volvo c40 with credit and receive 1000 off.  I paid cash and I didn’t qualify anymore.  They want you to finance, because that interest dwarfs the “discount” for financing. || Glad i bought a Honda in 2013. Haha || The pro move is buy on credit, then pay it off immediately. || We bought a 2011 (civic SI).  We're cheap asses so paid 4700 bux in 2020.  It's got more in upgrades than the car is worth and wakes me up when my son starts it in the morning.  If I could do it all over again, I'd make sure to insist on a stock vehicle, with original every except maybe the oil and tires lol || They had a minimum requirement of 3 months on finance.  There was a penalty to pay off early.  

Not sure why I was downvoted for giving a fact about Boston volvo.  

I bought my Volvo C40 65k cash.  No need to finance and deal with fake discounts. || Dang, they have penalties for early payment now? || What state are you in? In some states like California that’s illegal to have loan terms like that for car loans. || Volvo did.  Nissan did too about 8 years ago when I tried buying a car with cash.  I had to wait 2 months for that “penalty” to go away.  That was worth it, I think it was 3k off for financing.  The downside: they want you to use in house financing with shit rates instead of a credit union with lower 2.5% type rates. || I’m in Massachusetts."
I predict Apple will acquire Nissan in the next 18 months,"The Japanese automaker is facing severe financial challenges and may run out of cash within 12 months, putting it on the brink of bankruptcy.

Apple, with its bold ambitions to enter the electric vehicle (EV) market, has already invested over $10 billion in R&D for the Apple Car. Despite canceling the project earlier this year, that investment exceeds Nissan's current valuation.

Partnering with Nissan could help Apple overcome the manufacturing hurdles it faced with its EV project. Nissan has proven expertise, having produced the Nissan Leaf, the best-selling non-Tesla EV of all time.

The global EV market is one of the fastest-growing industries, projected to double by 2030. By acquiring Nissan, Apple could transform its vehicles into sleek, cutting-edge products that seamlessly integrate into the Apple ecosystem.

This move would allow Apple to directly challenge Tesla, reinforcing its position as the world’s most valuable company, ahead of competitors like NVIDIA and Microsoft.",Scorface,2024-12-04 01:36:44,0,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h5wpqf/i_predict_apple_will_acquire_nissan_in_the_next/,None,"No.  Nissan is a burning dumpster fire.  The appropriate move would be to let them go bankrupt, then buy the parts that are attractive (if there are any). || That’s the stupidest thing I’ve read today || They cleaned house and closed up shop.  Literally everyone involved with the Apple car is gone.  Why would they now try and restart it with a dumpster fire and no in house talent?  It would be a horrible decision.  Building cars sucks, it is low margine, and is incredibely suspetable to abnormal market conditions.  No way apple changes their mind on cars just because Nissan can't stay viable. || No fucking way. || Absolutely not happening || Didn’t they sell their EV lab in China and Xiaomi pretty much release those prototype as their own?

Appl pretty much give up on EV || This is the worst prediction Ive ever heard in my life || Apple doesn’t do splashy acquisitions there more about the tuck ins. Last big one I can think of is Beats but even that was small in context (couple bil) || Apple isn’t going into EV. Nissan is garbage || Interesting. I predict now that cars are just tablets on wheels the OS will be mainstreamed and not everyone will have their own like when smartphones once came out. Plenty of cars have already adopted Google OS and i suspect more will too. I bet Apple want to throw itself into that game || To me, a Japanese, it sounds no less absurd than UNIQLO taking over BA.

Nissan's EV cars are as powerful as the RC cars you can buy for $20. || >Despite canceling the project earlier this year || I highly doubt it. Nissan is exactly where they belong. Apple would be wasting money buying Nissan. || Apple would buy it for scraps. If you think a premium brand is buying a low cost car brand you’re out of your mind. || Beats is the one exception, otherwise Apple has never made acquisitions like this.  It just isn't how Apple does new product.  It's possible they would do some kind of partnership to understand the business better -- like they did with Motorola when they made the iTunes Phone/Rokr. || I predict Trump will issue martial law in the next 18 months || Apple will acquire ferrari in 2034 || Crazy but interesting call! || Nissan has been a smoldering dumpster fire for decades.  No way Apple will touch it or any part of what might be left || Nissan is Renault.(FR) || Think they could buy RIVN instead, electric car company and already has offices in silicon valley. Including a lot of former employees. But apple historically has not played the acquisition game like the other giants || Legacy ICE ≠ expertise in NEV. Apple won't touch Nissan. || What in the blue hell || You're way off. No way. Even before apple shut down their EV effort (& $10 billion over the 10 years was not horrendous as some claim) I felt they perhaps could have considered Lucid & Rivian. I feel it was best for Apple to stop the EV effort. They have many patents & knowledge from that project which do & will continue to have value. Review how Airplay is available in most new cars & think about why! || The last thing Tim needs is a failing brand in a cut throat industry with literally only a few companies making world-class margins of 10% lolol || Wait and see what happens with EV subsidies in the new administration. But the real question, I think, is this: to what extent can you monetize a vehicle throughout its lifecycle? || They won’t cars are a low margin highly cyclical business. Apple was working on a car for which they would have even partnered with an existing manufacturer and still stopped that project. Maybe with the exception of Tesla, EV are a money losing business. || Ok I will volunteer to be in charge of Nissan. First I’d do another Skyline GTR that’s closer to the 34 with modern tech and a base spec Skyline designed around being modded.


Then I’d fund a new fast and furious movie that is back to basics car culture and a new NFS most wanted game featuring the new GTR.


Make Nissan cool again. || The negativity in this thread bodes well for your prediction.


Popular sentiment here is wrong most of the time. Ask me how I know. || I don’t understand the hype around cars. The automotive industry has always been a struggle. High competition, high capex, and extremely low margins. All of these is the exact opposite of what Apple looks for. They can probably get around the competition due to their ecosystem, and get around the costs due to them making so much money already. However that still probably wouldn’t change the margins. Apple makes around a 40-50% profit margin on all of their devices while car companies typically make a 3-9% margins on a car which is horrible because the costs to make and sell are just way too high. 

Imo it’s not efficient for Apple to go into this at all and I would rather them use their cash to continue expanding their subscription services, grow their margins, expanding their plants into other parts of the world, and continue doing buybacks and dividends for investors. The car industry is a struggle and has way more potential downside with very low chances of upsides. || They just need it for manufacturing. They were previously going to partner with Kia for manufacturering is even less premium than Nissan [https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/02/03/apple-and-hyundai-kia-driving-towards-deal-on-apple-car.html](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/02/03/apple-and-hyundai-kia-driving-towards-deal-on-apple-car.html) || ... *so far* || Rivian is a possibility as well but it’s gonna be more expensive. The current market cap is not only 33% higher but it’s not in as dire straits as Nissan so Apple would have to pay more of a premium on top of current market cap to get board approval for the acquisition to go through. I think Rivian is superior to Nissan from a design and software perspective but those are the core compentices that Apple brings to the table. Nissan has a much more developed global manufacturing auto supply chain which Rivian lacks given their relatively small production volume. || Im intrigued by the idea minus the massive portion of the investment being for an ICE car manufacturing supply chain…. But disagree with the idea that in 2024 Nissan is more premium than Hyundai/Kia."

Long-term the stock is about where it was 20 years ago (and before that, was at this level in the late 1990's.)

 IMO, PFE is a stagnant dinosaur (I've called it the Immelt era GE of pharma) but a lot of people see a household name they know down a lot. 

The company has overpaid in an attempt to buy growth repeatedly over the years, so the company gets no credit for capital allocation possibilities with the cash they have. 

Could absolutely bounce again, but so many people have tried to call the bottom on here over the last two years and nobody has made the case why the next 5 years is going to be any different than the last 10-20. There was an excellent 72 page presentation by Starboard a few weeks back that went over all of Pfizer's many issues. If they were able to get a great new CEO from outside the company I'd be interested. Otherwise, something people can maybe play for a bounce but still not seeing a case for sustained improvement in the business itself. || No I think PfE has a lot of pain to go through 

- eliquis and Ibrance and Prevnar Losses of exclusivity 

- Falling Covid products

- no real substitute for eliquis and major blockbusters to undergo loss of exclusivity in 2028 

- severely overplayed for Seagen (I can’t overstate this enough). Merk themselves with the pressure to replace Keytruda walked out of a deal at a share price way below the agreed one with Pfizer 

- Discontinued Oxbryta which was recently acquired in 2022 for upwards of 5b

- little internal growth. Danuglipron seems all but assured for GLP-1 growth

- huge debt burden from poor acquisitions 


All this screams poor M&A strategy, weak management and blind management shooting the M&A shotgun blindly hoping to hit a blockbuster || trump is anti vaccine || I started a pretty big position - honestly just becuase they raised guidance for next year and the stock has been beaten down like crazy.

Maybe 500 PE. Who the fuck knows in this clown market || value/div has been irrelevant since the financial crisis.

we are in a new era of investing, tech which can squeeze outside insane profits margins fast because you don't have to build factories or infastructure (CAPEX) to grow.

for example with software, you just dev, then copy and paste as many times as you'd like, with instantaneous delivery and insane margins.

if you read the book the intelligent investor it outlines that these cycles happen and you have to re-evaluate what works. || Actually if we're talking later 2021 specifically, the Dow/SPX equal weight (and the S&P itself) held up great into the end of the year while tech stalled out, and that turned out to be a warning.


I'm kinda thinking the Nasdaq Composite makes the 20k milestone, but it's going to be kicking and screaming lmao (it's felt like it's been dragged up slowly). || Tech is div and value. The entire world runs on tech. Even your drink water boiler runs on tech if you want to.

I don’t understand this “artificial” thing. What does it actually mean? I bought something with very low liquidity today and actually moved the price slightly. If I moved it a lot would the price have moved artificially? When does price not move artificially? || cuz apparently brazil is getting smacked down || I own it and was so close to buying puts on it last week as a hedge 🫠 || What are your positions? This should be good news. You should be invested in a stock market index with good exposure here. Everyone on Reddit should be basically (presuming younger age demo) || Thanks. I bought today. 7 shares to keep the price afloat. || If you're investing in SP you dont need corrections, with individual stocks you absolutely need one because individual stocks work differently than etfs so I understand frustration of people, any tech stock can dump even 50% during a bear market where SP is usually 20-25% so you might be royally fucked as an individual stock picker. || I’m not sure that many people want it really, just the ones that do go on about it a lot. I’m pretty sure these are mostly people who invested in very conservative high dividend companies that have performed very poorly the last year or so, or have been mostly sat out from the market and want it drop so they can get what they missed, rather than the idea being driven by much logic. 

I know a case can be made for the market being at high valuations on the whole, but we can also make a case for there being a lot of value left in the market and the majority of the high value being due to shift in the big players of the stock market to high growth big tech that people probably rightly have a lot of faith in dominating for a long time. I feel like this has been pointed out so many times and makes a lot of sense, but some people don’t seem to want to acknowledge it. Even if you think big tech valuations are completely wild, there is still value in smaller companies.

I don’t know why the discussion has to center so much about the market as a whole needing to come down or go up really. It made sense when we were in the big bear market of 2022 and parts of 2023 and everything was getting hammered and it might make sense again at some point in the near future but for now I think we should concentrate on just finding opportunities. || I switched the orders from GTC to GTEM, and they went immediately, so I guess that was the problem.

We'll see. The contrarian indicators are setting up for such a scenario. I'd like to see them at higher extremes (NAAIM over 100, CBOE put/call below 0.81) before putting the trigger on any put setups. || So does that mean we could see a sell-off come 2025? || INTC dropping now lol || Is that really material given new admin coming in a month || They did implement some of the CSU incentive plans, specifically the one where executives must use their cash bonuses to buy company stock on the open market. || SMCI are in no way the main player of the AI boom. They were just one of the main stock market beneficiaries for a short time. One fraudulent company getting delisted shouldn’t affect sentiment around AI much if at all. The way you say this is as though it has been all hype with nothing to back it up which is clearly not true. || Ok conspiracy bro || Were you the guy praying for NVDA to turn out to be fraudulent as well or was that someone else? || My concern is that now so many people are convinced with this same mindset. It’s usually when the tables turn. || I feel like this is just a single day pullback. The last earnings went really well, so a 1 day fall of 10% on no news screams healthy profit taking on a rising star for me, with the sentiment of the last earnings still holding true that this stock is going to continue upwards.

* IWM: December 5th, $246 strike, 8k in calls
* IWM: December 5th, $248 strike, 7k in calls

Buy a December 6th contract for QQQ, one expiring next week for IWM. Make sure the size is very small: the JOLTS report may disrupt the normal price movement. You may want to run a 0DTE strangle for IWM instead. || Not gonna be able to afford it after this || NIKE has a new CEO ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm) || Tbh I feel like it’s a self feeding vicious cycles unless the FTC comes down hard.

These companies are profit money making machines. Huge profits little to no competition, zero debt, amazing balance sheets attracting the worlds best talent.

Why would you invest in anything else? || Good point. Interesting the market doesn't seem to care yet. || That was clearly the turn || Yeah looks alright to me, maybe something more subtle or just someone with a lot of shares wanted more?

I was getting an error trying to reply to your other comment about Dell for some reason so I’ll put it here:

I remember you mentioning this, AI seems to have been a fairly consistent strong point, with very good growth. You could argue that it may have reached its local peak but doesn’t make much sense say that the sentiment is going to drop like that. Must be based on the idea that the AI rally has no substance or has gotten way ahead of itself but that doesn’t look like reality to me. Probably will happen at some point but I don’t think so yet, it looks relatively rational to me.

On the other hand it seems possible to me that the PC market could start to pick up pretty soon. Might not be advancing as fast as it was but stuff does still break and need replacing fairly periodically, plus you can still get a fair bit more for your money than you could a few years ago. Maybe some sort of AI hardware advancements for personal computers will become more sought after as well? || Thanks. || Yeah after they've run so much it's not surprising companies like RCAT, UMAC, RKLB, etc are taking a dive. || You know it! || Wrote dump instead of pump by accident? || Do you have any books you recommend that talk about that? Or any resources really || You never know sometimes lol. Yeah just one of my gripes is when things get lumped together when there is some nuance. || I could see a top happening before year end, probably around OPEX in the 20th. 

I'm sort of in the ""no big selloffs before year end"" group. 

Still, confident in the general prognosis. Either way, I'm not particularly excited to initiate new longs, unless there's a short term catalyst coming. || Poor INTC, thats brutal || Whether or not the rules matter in the long run is irrelevant to the short-term reaction of the market. This is why SMH is mooning today. || It looks like it’s a little different from CSU’s program though. Seems like CMG.to’s bonuses only partially need to buy company stock. || One the latest reports we got around Capex spending was like DELL which saw their general AI market grow like 50%. I don't remember if it was YoY or QoQ, but there is still growth there.

However, the company still missed revenue goal due to weakness in like the PC market. || are you referring to me merely pointing out some weird accounting red flags and somehow turning that into me saying NVDA is a complete fraud? || No, it's the mindset you need to have. The mistake is thinking otherwise and missing out on great gains. || u/eggplant_parm827  is correct. Just look back at any of the big corrections/recessions of the past 2 decades, you can barely see them wehn you zoom out the graph. You are right that there will be a correction, its inevitable. It is just foolish to try and time it perfectly. If you don't need the money in the next 2-3 years, staying invested is the best play you can make || Wow that’s a lot on money in contracts haha, thanks for sharing. Is there any reason you don’t just wanna wait for the jolts report to reconsider? Also, would it be fine to just run a QQQ 5/20 December 6th call only? || TMDX - Turning shareholders into customers. || exactly. I dont see ANYTHING taking tech down in the near term. 

it certaintly wont be legacy dividend stocks. 

it will be some future tech play or other disruptive tech (quantum, space, gene editing etc) || Joe, the other commenter, makes a good point but it's also worth considering that [foreign phone sales](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/s/RULWu5i0D9), of which the iPhone is dominant, have fallen 44% in China this year already. So maybe it's that it's already fallen so steeply that they've already been expecting a reduced market. || It might be because if you sell Apple for a lot of those people they have to buy something else to stay invested. So they might prefer to wait until there is actual proof Apple earnings will be bad before selling. || As far as the ZS move, i always wait until the market opens to really care too much around AH's pricing. 

However, if I was long on the company, there is no red flags imo and i'm sure the stock will bounce back at some point. 

Yeah, I think the fear with AI, is still the overall ROI. Companies are spending a ton and we don't really have much to show for it yet. I personally think there is better ROI in Machine Learning over pure LLM's. 

With the PC thing, that's what I think a lot of the street is thinking around AI demand for devices. Since a lot of the compute still happens on cloud, there is work trying to get into the device itself. I do think we are due for a PC upgrade cycle soon, since a ton of people upgraded during the pandemic, but that was about 4/5 years ago now. Which is aligns with the normal upgrade time. 

At least for chips, a lot of the markets have been basically flat or down outside of the cloud compute stuff. It's been a bad market for industrial and auto chips. || I'm enjoying the ride up as will I the elevator down. It's the cycle of life (markets). || They aren't V recoveries. They are checkmark recoveries.

Cause after a tiny red, we get waaaaay more green and go well above the previous levels. || Normally you'd have to be a CTA or CMT to have the theory and practice together. You can't just look at candlesticks. You have to have the whole package (volume analysis, ATR, MFI, AVWAP, etc.) and know which collection of indicators apply to what stock.

A good starting point is *Technical Analysis*, 2nd Edition by Charles Kirkpatrick and Julie Dahlquist. || If there was a book that could teach you how to predict the market, nobody would work. || Truthfully, it could occur as early as tomorrow with the JOLTS report or the trade deficit on Thursday. When everyone's piling in at the same time, it only takes one bad piece of news to create a sell-off.

I initiated some new long-term positions last week and this morning. || I just sold a bunch to avoid the wash sales rules because I expect the dip after the new year and will be hunting. || Thanks! I'm still in the early learning phase on this one. || The market will likely move overnight in anticipation of the report; premiums are already starting to rise before the day ends. You don't necessarily want to guess the direction of the movement - bad news might be interpreted as bad news, good news, or no news - and you can always close early if the result is benign.

Yes, that's fine. || China is giving foreign phone manufacturers some serious competition. Between Xiaomi, Oppo, and Huawei, I can see Apple and everyone else continue to slip rapidly there. || You're describing me! 20% in AAPL, thinking about trimming and invest in another overvalued Mag 7 (AMZN). || Yeah fair enough, I just find it interesting to see the reaction to earnings, partly because I like to bet on the moves sometimes, but the immediate swings do seem to be often quite random unless there’s something very surprising in the earnings release.  We have seen some pretty strong reversals when the market opens lately so maybe you’re right, could be better to ignore AH most of the time.

You could definitely make the argument that companies are going overboard with their AI spending, but then on the other hand the companies that are doing this have a lot of cash and people are hoping for growth and it does seem to be the best bet. Kind of building the infrastructure right now and only time will tell how well it will pay off as with any investment but seems like a pretty reasonable bet to make to me on the whole. Seems kind of similar to me to when big tech was betting on cloud computing when that was newer. (I know AI isn’t new by the way before anyone picks me up on that). I suppose with the AI there is more risk and a lot less certainty on the revenue that it will generate though compared to cloud computing.

Like you say with chips and EV stuff not performing that well, this is partly why I just don’t see the market as being in this absolutely crazy place that some claim. There is a lot of tech stuff left that will undoubtedly see a big increase in demand at some point but people are hesitant because the results haven’t been that good lately. It’s not the wild euphoric market mindset in my opinion. Even some stuff that are fairly big players related to the AI space have taken a beating like ASML and AMD. || very true. The V sounds better, but you're correct. || The basic components behind a successful company have been known for almost a century, yet the average retail investor barely beats inflation on a year-to-year basis. 🤔 || Oh definitely. I try to preface with: unless something big happens. 

I'm mostly convinced the market doesn't want to sell yet, unless forced. || Makes sense appreciate the explanation. Is there any reason you didn’t just buy December 6th? Also: isn’t this generally considered very risky running a call with so little days to expiration. Do you persoanlly believe QQQ will reach the 520 strike or are you just riding the move up and exiting? || Oh no doubt about that. However the retaliatory tariffs (if they come) would hardly help. || literally the strategy is to just invest in overavlued mega caps. 

investing in undervalued lagging stocks has been horrible. 

what a weird time to invest in. 

thinking google is a good deal? meh, forget it, invest in tesla isntead., way better gains. || I can't believe some of these prices it's hilarious. Aapl 240. Tsla 350. Pltr 67. Fucking hilarious || And yet the majority of professionals who do study the basic components behind successful companies also struggle to beat the market over the long term. 🤔 || Well, retail doesn't want to sell. Insiders have been selling furiously and piling up cash. || December 6th for IWM? The increase in the premiums are too high to run a strangle more than a day or two out, and time decay makes it dangerous to have expiration so close to the putative move. 

The setup means that the market maker will buy shares to delta hedge as QQQ moves towards the target price. The ETF has shown reliable momentum since November 15th as well, putting the odds in our favor. || And it will look cheap when AAPL is 300, TSLA 500 and PLTR 100. I mean why not? name any fantasy price. Will probably get there since stocks only go up with no downside risk. || Ironically, this is partially due to them coming to mimic the SPY in their portfolio construction. Throw in pressure for quarterly performance, eroding margins with hedges and so forth, very limited stock selection, etc.  and it's not surprising.

The problem is structural incentives, not knowledge. They sabotage themselves in ways that would not occur if they were not managing investments as a job. || Oh, retail is in euphoria mode. 

The amount of posts bragging about gains in November are nuts. || Sorry I meant for QQQ. I noticed you played December 3rd || I hope shit gets that expensive. Gonna be sooooo much money to be made on the way down. || By that logic, these professionals should be filthy rich in their own personal accounts then, even if their performance at work is limited.  This is decidedly not the case. || Window dressing on buying the biggest outperformed at quarter end to make their books look better essentially makes these clowns buy high and sell low || You should buy the December 6th contract for QQQ with the anticipated move occurring on December 3rd. If the underlying doesn't move, you can exit with a slight loss. || Do you have any short positions? || Serious question for you. What's your take on GOOG's current valuation? || ...do you have evidence of this? Professionals don't share their books. The ones I know personally do very well. || Ohhh gotcha so that’s when you think the move will occur. Thanks. || Nope. Just SGOV and EOSE and waiting to turn that SGOV into something else with better risk reward than a 27 forward PE SPY || The only fairly valued company that's even tangentially related to tech or ai 

But I fuckong despise them for making youtube unwatchable and I am an idiot who refuses to invest in companies I hate even if they are good value || Every single research study ever done has shown that there is zero evidence that anyone, including professionals, are able to predict what the market will do.  If there was truly some secret to investing, surely it would have been discovered and studied by now over the last 100+ years.  But honestly, the easiest way to know this isn't true is because if they really did know the secret to investing, they wouldn't be working a 9-5 as stock analysts and fund managers."
Does AVGO is rise count as a gift?,"Since October 2024, Broadcom has underperformed many of its technology peers as investors have rebalanced their allocations to the semiconductor sector.

Despite the recent relative weakness, Broadcom has remained in line with the S&P 500, demonstrating stability.

Broadcom expects AI revenue to reach $12 billion in fiscal 2024, accounting for less than 25% of total revenue.

Custom AI chips are at the core of Broadcom is AI revenues, accounting for up to two-thirds of the total, driven primarily through partnerships with hyperscalers such as Microsoft, AWS, and Google.

Customized chips are expected to play a more important role over the next five years, helping customers address AI cluster scaling and cost challenges.

Broadcom is leadership in the networking market could be challenged by NVIDIA, which is capturing the market with more competitive networking solutions.

Broadcom is growth in AI, while promising, is still a low percentage of overall revenue from AI.

Weakness in the non-AI revenue segment could undermine the market's bullish confidence in Broadcom.

Wall Street is constructive on Broadcom, but future guidance needs to remain strong to maintain market confidence.

Broadcom is forward-looking PEG ratio of 1.69 is attractive compared to the tech sector average of 1.89.

I think attention needs to be paid to the company's execution in AI and potential headwinds in non-AI businesses.

On balance, Broadcom stock is under short-term pressure, but the long-term bullish logic remains in place for investors who are optimistic about AI growth prospects.

Broadcom is long-term growth potential remains with its AI business and custom chip capabilities.

What do we think about IOVA?,"Firstly congrats everyone on RKLB, ACHR and LUNR gains. It was fun ride, I have to be honest I had jumped off the wagon a bit earlier but hat off to all of you that mooned! 

Also for some of you that jumped on ZETA, enjoy the good days that await. 

But let’s talk about IOVA…:

Another biopharma stock trying to solve the issues of cancer. An industry that is a Holy Grail for all pump and dumpers out here. 

But is this one different? To be honest I do not know, but that is why I am posting this. To hear other sides, other points of view. 

IOVA is currently sitting around $9. These are levels of before the this year run to $16 (what goes up must come down, when pumped and dumped). However… this company reported revenues, 90.86mil revenue to be precise. Granted, not enough to support current market cap but bear in mind it is bio industry we talk about. It takes 1 approval and it is too late.

Leadership:
CEO is there since 2016, seems like an experienced guy. Was contributor to many oncology drugs already developed and approved.

Others seem legit as well, this post is already too long… feel free to research yourself.

They also own a bit less than 12% so there is certain commitment there.  And of course the vanguard, black rock etc. are heavily involved as well. More than 87% is owned by institutions. 

Amtagvi product got approved by FDA and that is now generating certain revenue. They plan tk get approval in Canada, Europe and UK as well. 

They also work on LN-145, IOV-4001 and IOV-3001 but let’s be honest these are long shots and nothing guarantee success of these.

I know these are speculations and putting some numbers from the future is no way to go but I feel like I have to just to make this post a bit more complete.

Potential yearly revenue if approved broader and if nothing goes wrong  is 12billion (amount of people with cancer of specific type * cost of treatment) but realistic values at beginning is 1-2bill per year or even less. 

And then for all the gamblers time that with moon if other drugs get approved as well.

It is not a drug that you can ramp up as fast as you want, with gross margins of 85%, where after commercialization the only limit is the demand in the market, or the size of your sales team. || There's a class action lawsuit against ZETA now ‐ copied press release

Here's a summary of this article.
ZETA
+12.72%
The Law Offices of Frank R. Cruz announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Zeta Global Holdings Corp. (“Zeta” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ZETA) securities between February 27, 2024 and November 13, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Zeta investors have until January 21, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion.

If you are a shareholder who suffered a loss, click here to participate.

On November 13, 2024, Culper Research published a report alleging that the “integrity of the Company’s data collection and reported financials” is severely undermined by two factors. First, the report alleged that “Zeta has formed ‘two-way’ contracts with third party consent farms wherein the Company simultaneously acts as both a supplier and a buyer of consumer data,” allowing the Company to “flatter reported revenue growth” and indicating possible “round-tripping” of revenue. Second, the report alleged that Zeta’s collects the majority of its customer data from a network of “sham websites that hoodwink millions of consumers each month into handing their data over to Zeta under false pretenses.” For example, the report alleged the Company and its subsidiaries operate a number of fake job boards which are designed to trick individuals into submitting personal data under the pretense of job applications. The report further alleged that the Company’s “most valuable data” comes from these predatory websites, dubbed consent farms, which are “responsible for almost the entirety of the Company’s growth.”

On this news, the Company’s stock price fell $10.46, or 37.07%, to close at $17.76 per share on November 13, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Zeta used two-way contracts to artificially inflate financial results; (2) that Zeta engaged in round trip transactions to artificially inflate financial results; (3) that Zeta utilized predatory consent farms to collect user data; (4) that these consent farms have driven almost the entirety of Zeta’s growth; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

But then again, the whole market is…. || that is so true, like I said it is scam field but just wondering if there are exceptions || Yeah it’s risky to buy a biotech company’s stock when the company is not profitable yet but IOVA has the only FDA approved stage 4 melanoma treatment on the market right now. So this is at least different than a not profitable biotech company with no FDA approvals. 

Also it’s possible they get FDA approval for other solid tumor cancers. 

I am long IOVA || >But then again, the whole market is….

Seeking Alpha Black Friday Sale,"Is it just me, or does the Seeking Alpha Black Friday sale seem extremely unremarkable? They raised their price from $239 to $299 a year a few months ago, then when Black Friday comes they make the ""Sale"" the $239 price. What a deal, eh?

I recently got WSJ/Barrons/Marketwatch/IBD for $7 a month. Yahoo Finance's free version is basically Seeking Alpha lite. FastGraphs normal price is what Seeking Alpha is charging as their ""sale"" price.

What caused their inflationary pricing to go up so much for Seeking Alpha? Importing tech from China increased? Midwest farmers crops went bad and they jacked the price up?

Their subscription price has doubled in the last 3 years. To me, it just shows they have no problem giving their customers the middle finger while taking as much as they can from them. 

What gives? Thoughts?",Vaporzx,2024-12-01 18:13:04,68,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h42h3k/seeking_alpha_black_friday_sale/,None,"Do people actually pay for subscriptions in this space? (not trying to start an argument, genuinely curious)

I donate a few dollars a year to Marketplace on NPR but that’s about it. || I'm Chinese. It only costs 12 dollars a year to buy seeking alpha membership on Taobao in China. || I can’t believe anyone pays for SA. It offers absolutely nothing but opinion pieces written by amateur investors. You can do the same “research” by perusing the comments of financial related Reddit forums.

SA is a fun site for discussion… and little else. || I hot the Barron/WSJ/marketwatch bundle for 4 bucks a month ago || I think a lot, if not most, black Friday ""deals"" are something similar, where they raise the price before and then drop the price on black Friday back to the normal price || I would pay money to not read seeking alpha || I have seen so many companies do that. They raise prices, and then announce sale events where they revert back to selling products/services at the same price they were not long ago. It's super shady and one of the reasons I don't buy into the whole 'Black Friday' deals anymore. I highly recommend everyone to do their research before buying. || SeekingAlpha has a really nice user interface. Best of any app I’ve found. Not saying it justifies the price, but it’s good. || Tradingview black Friday is the best deal imo || Is Seeking Alpha better than Motley Fool? || I tried to post twice in this sub about their “alpha picks” service which is on sale for $400/yr but stupid mods removed it. Anyway I was asking if it was worth the money… || I got all the articles except for some ""premium"" articles free for several years and about 5-6 months ago it was no longer free.  Not sure what changed or how I originally signed up for free.  I dont miss it and now when they send me emailed updates I just delete them since I cant read the linked articles.  Still looking how to quit the sign up I did many years ago.  I tried a few times but if I cant find it in a minute or 2 I just leave the web site. I may just identify their emails as SPAM and let the email program block them || I use Seeking Alpha stock quotes and graphs which are free. (Also Google Finance). A quick and easy way to see stock performance for 1-day, 5-days, 1-month, 6-months, YTD, 1-year, 5-years, 10-years, and Max. || Seekingalpha is the only one I continue paying. It helped me find APP and 10x returns || I got seeking alpha premium recently and it is pretty incredible. I've yet to come across a better website. It has so much information and top-quality research. If you're serious about investing and want to keep up with the markets and trends, I highly recommend it. || Not saying I ever do this,……but it makes no sense to pay for seeking alpha when you can just turn off JavaScript and bypass the paywall || They can charge more because their loyal subscribers know they are getting their money's worth.  I make many times more on strategies using their Quant ratings then the cost of the subscription. || You don’t need any of those subscriptions. Just free stuff is enough, including Yahoo Finance. || I’ve always wondered. Are the articles on there helpful? || [removed] || I use market chameleon and it's worth the 100 a month for me. Been using it to find good stocks been crushing some good calls lately. But who ain't in this market lol || Seems like all the apps are doing something sneaky like this || Haven't really used the site since they put everything behind a paywall. I used to read the free articles when that existed, but I wouldn't pay for any of what I read. || Try StockOpine’s newsletter Black Friday deal instead. || I just use y'alls subscriptions. || Overpriced || My friend wants to go half and half on sa. Is it worth it lol || Hard pass on SA. || I would never pay for seeking alpha… so many well respected investors release letters for the public to view, for free… || Not worth $1/mo || I have very bad toots after Thanksgiving eating || Seeking alpha is super trash. I think at this point you can google them posting 2 opposite trades at the same time. One bullish one bearish then reposting the one that works as part of their win rate. || I bought a £2 a month sub to WSJ / MW although I’m not sure how much it’s actually helped me. Most of my ideas have come from random places, podcasts etc || I got a free year of Fool once and it was basically pointless. I was surprised at how little unique intel they offered. || This is the way.

Listen to Marketplace on NPR.  Read real news articles.  

Don’t put too much credence or trust into places like Seeking Alpha or Motley Fool… || Some people got rich selling shitty courses and stuff on Discord. So yea, people pay money. Peoples fear of missing out is easy to prey upon if you are a dipshit || Right?! I use several free sites that are good at different things and get the entire picture. I can't justify paying hundreds of dollars subscription for a DD to save several minutes. || $300 a year is nothing when my portfolio is growing by $20k a year. It is a lot of money for a subscription, but that site offers all of the information I want to see about a company in one easy to navigate place. In 15 to 30 minutes I can learn the revenue/income trends, what events caused prior share price declines, and what analysts and individual investors are thinking is happening, or will happen going forward. 

If I was able to research stocks full time I could probably get a good feel for 5 or 6 different stocks a day by using their interface. I'll admit, I have not used any other site for research though, so I don't have any comparison. There might be better options out there. || 2 dollars a month for WSJ is way worth it || I pay for Bloomberg because I read their articles everyday and enjoy the opinion pieces. You have to support journalism one way or another || I alternate between paid subs to WSJ or Bloomberg (would like both, but they are kind of expensive), along with WaPo, NYT, and some local papers. Important to distinguish between actual journalism and whatever seeking alpha does. || Some do, but I wont be exploited. If I see a value at a fair price then I will. $239 for Seeking Alpha is exploitive.

I haven't heard of Marketplace on NPR before but I'll definitely check it out. || Look at this guy - asking the real questions. || I paid for Tradingview Essentials. It's just a nice tool to watch all my stocks + after hours development on my iPad casually. Depending on the size of your depot, it's basically peanuts. Also the IBKR integration is quite nice. || There's an arbitrage opportunity in here somewhere lol. Do you have access to American articles as well? I generally avoid Seeking Alpha so I have no idea what is on there. || can you help me with getting it ? || I agree. I'm learning from this thread that there are people who value these opinion articles? That's a lot of reading time for a lot of noise. 

For me, a service has to be information positive to justify itself on my subscription list. I'd rather spend that money on data streams, I guess. || Seeking alpha also has industry professionals that have been in the game for 20+ years. It’s not all amateur shitters. || Tons of stores around the US are doing the exact same sale they *were doing* and have been doing for the last few months.

Saw a video where a target shopper pulled up the ""Black friday"" slip in the plastic holder only to reveal a sale where the TV was the same price. Looking online by sku number, the TV was the same price at other places with no sale as it was at target on sale. || Yes, way better, just make sure to go back and check the analysts older work to see their track record || no || It has been worth it for me. It’s crushing the market. || For me the most valuable part of seeking alpha is the comment section lol || It's written by bloggers/investment firms. Each with their own opinion  || For Seeking Alpha's profits, yes. For your retail investor, no. || If you pay for SA, it’s same level as REDDIT || I bought it last year on a whim, never really used it. || Motley Fool gives out thousands of recommendations per year and then they go back and only highlight the stocks that did well. || Idk why you’re getting downvoted, you’re totally right. I haven’t found another app that has all the information I need to know in such a concise UI.

I share a login though so I’m not paying full price lol. || Where do you see $2 a month? The subscription price shows as $2 a week for me || Literally anyone can write on Seeking Alpha if they pass the editorial team. It's basically crowdsourced journalism (so quality can be... unreliable). || I don't mind paying that price, it can pay for itself easily with just one good investment || Eh, there’s approximately one author who validates my biases so it is worth it for that. I also pay for Bloomberg (news) and get some mileage out of that too. Not bad pricing for financial entertainment. || Of course, we see the same website and the same article. || There’s some. But even a majority of them are trying to scam you into an investing group or subscription service for $100’s per year on top of the SA premium sub. And I would bet the information you’d gain access to by following them wouldn’t be much more beneficial than having me, a nobody, share my portfolio updates with you.

It’s all a money making scheme, bro. There’s no edge they can give you that you can’t gain from buying and holding index ETFs or a basket of dividend aristocrats. Investing the smart, boring… proven way always wins out in the long term. || I love the comment section 😄 || Well that sounds like it’d be all over the place 😵‍💫 || Thanks you saved me a search. Was just contemplating on Fool services. || Even on the mobile app, all the information is just as easy to get to. It's fantastic. 

I used the site for free, for years. But now they only allow you to access a few articles per month in a free account. In september I decided to bite the bullet and just pay the $300 a year. || In Canada. It’s 50 cents per week

Roth MKM takes TSLA target to 380,"Roth MKM upgraded Tesla to a Buy rating from Neutral, citing increased demand potential linked to Elon Musk's perceived alignment with former President Donald Trump.

The defense Sector - Can those Earnings be sustained in peace times. ,"T hasn't made it to the white house yet and he's already cleaning house and arranging furniture, meeting with heads of state as if he's really running things. He's lucky Elon is right there next to him doing the heavy lifting to make things more - efficient.

It got me wondering about the defense sector. The pentagon has failed every audit for the last several years which leads me to believe all these defense contractors are getting kick backs off the books but also their contracts might be over inflated and they taking advantage of Uncle Sam's check book because he doesn't really know what hes signing off on.

Its possible the Dept of Justice might sue them to pay back their, corrupt pricing over the years.

The other factor is Jan 20th inauguration day. Trump clearly said he's not paying a dollar more to Ukraine, so that means billions of dollars is no longer going to flow to the bottom line. Hezbollah and Israel signed a deal. So things are staring to look more peaceful. Zelensky said he might be willing to make concessions on land to make peace.

So the question is, are defense contractors overvalued?

I just don't think they'll be able to sustain earnings like the last two years. The spending will drastically slow.",Euro347,2024-12-02 20:51:57,0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h4xd4y/the_defense_sector_can_those_earnings_be/,None,"Frankly your thesis is flawed from the start if you think Trump entering office means “peace times” are coming. Good luck! || I would add that preparing for war never ends. Even in peace times you are doing upgrades, maintenance and serious R&D to prepare for future technology maturity. In all likelihood we will need to spend more to incorporate AI and the technology of today into tomorrow's weapons as well as restock older supplies that were used in Ukraine. || Preparation of war=Growth


Beginning of war=Zero || > So things are staring to look more peaceful

If this is what you think peace looks like...

But also, Trump pushed military spending when he was in office last time.

German market - Volkswagen,"I started investing in stock market around 8 years ago and at that time I only did that through my bank in my European country. Time passing and all these broker apps did it so much easier to invest in stock market and NYSE seemed so appealing, that I totally forgot about other markets the last years.
So here I am today, checking German market and specifically Volkswagen and I cannot figure out why is it so much undervalued. I mean look at this EBITDA and cash on hand.
Is there something I missing of? Do you think Trump can hurt Europe that much? Did whole Europe stop investing in European countries? Do you think that German auto manufacturers don’t worth their value? 
What’s your opinion about this?",dipster23,2024-12-01 10:46:25,61,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h3vzop/german_market_volkswagen/,None,"[removed] || No. This will be very difficult. The far too important China business is running out and VW still needs about 2 years until they are on the market with a competitive e-car platform. At the same time, the price war is ruinous and the cost structures of VW are not comparable to, for example, Chinese OEMs. The strategic pivot to the US market has been even more questioned since Trump. The only downside for me is that VW is better positioned than any other volume manufacturer. However, the car industry in general and volume OEMs in particular are low in margins. The only German manufacturer that currently does quite well is for me BMW. || The fall of German automakers has made headlines all throughout 2024. 

For VW in particular, they are looking to close some plants in Germany while fighting resistance from unions.

Workers want a payrise.

Their labor costs are much higher than other European automakers at 15.4% of revenue compared to the 9.5% to 11% for Mercedes, BMW and Stellantis. 

At $66 per hour, Germany has the highest labor costs in the world.
USA $44 per hour and Japan $24 per hour.

Their luxury brands (Audi, Bentley and Porsche) saw declining revenues. Only Lamborghini revenues increased.

They are losing in the EU EV market of all places, with Tesla and Chinese EVs outselling them.

They are losing market share in China. They are closing China plants as a result.

They are losing their small market share in USA.

I wouldn't invest in VW. I would want them to separate their best assets. Divest Porsche. Macan/Cayenne/Taycan/Panamera - they should stay with VW and be rebadged. Porsche should just sell 718 + 911. Divest Lamborghini. That's their only growing businesses - Lamborghini and Porsche sports cars. || i dont know much about the topic but if you just look at the profit per car, you can kind of understand what is wrong with the industry.


you are selling these massively expansive cars and you are making like 150$ per cars.  and since you are already massively invested, you are forced to produce big numbers of cars per year.  and if your car dont sale, you are toast.  you cant cut the price because you are already in thin margin.  or if you are forced to cut price you end up lossing money massively.


just look at nissan news today.   || lots of problems with EV sales in Germany, not selling as well as they thought. Also energy costs are too high in Germany, so lots of companies are actually going bankrupt or leaving Germany. || Pressure from EU emissions regulations, fierce competition. Not a lot of room for growth/innovation. But they're a massive company and theyre gonna be around forever so no harm in buying if you don't mind holding for years || German economy is in really bad shape, and tariff trade war with China will end really badly for German automakers - they sell most of their cars abroad, and build them with imported Chinese materials. There's a reason they wanted to avoid them. I would stay away. || I have been holding VOW for a good 2 years and 3 months, I lost faith in the company lately, closing factories down and decreasing the net profit by 50% is no joke. Also, the entire German car manufacturer ecosystem is sick. 
As well, VW used to be the best seller cars in China, which is changing rapidly, which will hurt VW deeply. 
Also, they still need to invest a massive amount of money to develop a profitable EV business that will hurt even more their margins. 

There are much better opportunities out there to make money. || Volkswagen cant sell cars. They are even giving 50% discount in China. Inventory is piling up. They are closing down at least 3 manufacturing locations in Germany. I wouldn’t touch it. || 1. Can't sell EVs.

2. German economy slowing. 

3. Need to cut costs by 17bln and have a heavily unionised workforce which will make it tough.

4. Highly politicised situation too. State of Lower Saxony has seats on supervisory board.

5. Price competition from China. 

Will be a few years before it's sorted so I wouldn't buy just yet.

See what FY figures turn out to be. || Unpopular opinion but it brings me joy to see all these companies that turned their backs on loyal western customers to chase Chinese dollars slowing getting pushed out of China.

I wish it happened sooner, and I hope it continues to happen for some time. The suits need to learn there is a penalty for screwing over your customers. || Latest 30% drop is on me. I looked at their numbers and decided it was a good investment around 6months ago. I plan to hold for 10 years. By then dividends should have payed for the shares and hopefully they will have rebalanced on their market share. || Probably best cars ever made. Shitty stocks. || In my opinion, VW streamlined their products too much and while that helped at the time, basically every brand they touched, transformed it into another VW with a different badge. Specially the interior and what's under the hood and charge prices solely on the image that brand built before. Their cars are very expensive to maintain due to the backwards engineering that frankly doesn't improve the car that much to make you go through all that hustle. The only difference I noticed between Audi and a VW is sound insulation. Everything else feels relatively the same and people don't feel like they're getting more value out of more expensive cars. Their parts are expensive even if you want to do the work yourself and nothing is straightforward compared to BMW or Mercedes. People now care more about reliability and cheaper maintenance since most brands offer decent functions. Audi A3 starts at ~33k euro and don't even come with auto dimming mirrors. || Some good nuggets of information in here. If you think about the car industry as a whole, VW has long been the good quality car choice for the \*average\* European (and German). If you want a sporty car, you get BMW, you want a luxury car, you get Mercedes, you have money... well there are options. Why good quality? Because German technology gave their engines an edge. 

With the movement to electric vehicles, there is no combustion engine, i.e. VW has no edge compared to other cars. They tried to sell their EV's in China, but they can't compete. The Chinese cars are coming to Europe and have a cost advantage too. BMW, Mercedes and even Audi can at least justify some of their price with more features (luxury, sporty, techy, whatever). VW is in the mass market.

Less demand for cars with combustion engines, other car makers are also catching up as well (I see a lot more Skodas and Volvos in Europe right now), and low hopes of competing in the EV market. 

The German economy is really struggling right now. They are reducing costs wherever they can. And I can imagine that companies are reducing their B2B deals with the car makers. Germany will always be the biggest consumer of German cars. 

VW's business model just seems to be a victim of the changing demands of consumers. || Volkswagen might not exist in ten years time. || You're basing the value up on past stats not forward outlook. 

They're struggling, laying off thousands. They will not be innovating much in the next decade. German software industry is archiach and cannot keep up with rest of the world. Even without China, the self inflicted damage by Germany puts a cap on most large German OEMs. I see this first hand in my line of work. It's not an EV problem nor China problem. It's a Germany and VW problem exacerbated by these two. 

Tread with caution.

I'd wait until policies and company strategy updates next year. I don't think this is the bottom yet. || Shorting opportunity at this point ? || Volkswagen is now out of the electric car market in the US for right now. They were going all electric by 2025 which didn't work out. ID4s weren't selling. UAW is now at VW, and I predict that plant will move to Mexico eventually. I think VW closed two plants in Germany and I heard from a  friend that works there that they reduced the employee salaries in Germany by 10%. || Never really noticed this stock. Is it any good || Its my largest holding, I think its super undervalued || Car industry is never a good business to invest in. Just too much capital is needed || Vw got destroyed in China and now China is opening factories in all continents to finally destroy vw || [deleted] || Deadest of dead money 

In fact Germany might be non investible in my opinion || Car stocks in general are uncertain for me because the governments don't want ICE cars while the people don't want EV cars. Until they pull back on this I'm not touching them || Debt tho?  || I think the entire autos market is going to screwed for several years. German auto makers are extra screwed. They're so far behind the curve. 

One German company I've started positions is $BAYRY. It's involved in too many important industries. And the German government will need to support the company as a means of the country’s economic survival. || I would rather gamble my money into Rivian or invest in Toyota than buying any European car maker, let alone Volkswagen who used to be a big player in China but has lost its edge completely now. || There are talks that china can buy out vw, also vw been slow with evs also they had too many bad rep as of last few years. This means prople dont wanna buy this shit || Thanks this was very informative and agree about the importance of protecting jobs || I thought only the US could deduct taxes on stocks and never looked into it, can you explain how can an European investor use the tax deduction? || Well put, VW slept on the change in demand and they were too arrogant to react. They are 3-5 years behind || >  I totally forgot about other markets


This. 


Take any sector. A leading U.S. company in that sector will always be better off than a non-U.S. company. There're just too many reasons for this to list out, but top #3 are: easier and cheaper access to funds, larger market, better business climate.


From investor's point of view, VW, BMW, Merc. stock valuations will be compared to Ford, GM (not talking about product quality or market perception of cars), and if one *has to* pick, Ford and GM are better stocks by valuation and risk. || Chinese automakers aren't outselling VW in Europe. From Q1 to Q3 2024 there's only a single Chinese model in the Europe top 20, the MG4, [see here](https://alternative-fuels-observatory.ec.europa.eu/general-information/news/september-2024-european-electric-vehicle-market-resumes-growth). The Chinese aren't currently as strong and significant of a force as many people claim, although that may, and likely will change.

VW is in trouble currently because they've lived very well off the Chinese ICE market, but since you basically can't get an ICE vehicle registered there anymore, the consumers are buying EVs. Unfortunately VW's EV lineup, while decent, really doesn't appeal to the Chinese, so they lose sales in China. The Europe sales are fine, although VW obviously has higher ambitions when it comes to EV sales.

The workers aren't going to get a raise, they're laughably overpaid already in a German context, to the point where many people have little sympathy with them.

VW needs to get it oversized bureaucracy and managment overhead in order, focus on quality software experiences and lower their prices to gain market share. 

The car industry as whole is having a hard time right now, it's not unique to VW. They're not going away. Having said that, I wouldn't touch their stock. || All good points. Energy prices are also a factor and even if the war with Ukraine ended tomorrow the future of energy prices is uncertain. || So you want them to rebadge the already rebadged cars? That doesn’t make any sense || I hate VW, but this crisis is just temporary I'm sure. || You think they’ll keep distributing dividend? || Value trap territory. Very ballsy. || I’m so sorry for you. 
I don’t think they will make it back. || sorry for your loss || lol || Every EU country has different tax laws, so I cannot comment on that. I am based in Germany. || They were a bit taken aback by dieselgate, too. || Ford is terrible.  I have been bagholding too long.  There is no growth.  A decent dividend if you got in at the right time but that's about it.  Any time the stock shows some progress, a big recall that costs them billons will drag it back down.  Their EV's have been a failure and are now back to the drawing board to hurry out hybrids.  They are so far behind the other car makers.  Source: I am a direct supplier || Thanks for bringing it up, VW is not doing too bad on EVs in Europe as I thought.

That said, just as MG is Chinese, not british, Volvo cars is Chinese too. || Why wouldn't you touch the stock? Give little more insight please. || Yes. I think Volkswagen made an extremely questionable move.

It would increase Porsche's brand value by focusing on their strengths.

Why are Ferrari and Hermes doing the best versus other luxury?

Because they don't dilute their brand by increasing short term revenues by targeting another class of consumer.

Nothing stopping Ferrari from milking their brand in the short-term, destroying it long-term by putting their badge on affordable SUVs. || Yes, they make a lot of money (PE is under 4). But dividend will probably be reduced. I hope they keep some extra money to eleminate debt. Lower debt makes the investment safer and should save them money on interest long term. I tend to like companies that reduce their debt load, as they make money, because it's an indicator that they think long term and that they understand healthy financials are important. || Thanks || Are they developing full hybrid? || We're comparing it to VW.. so, ""no growth or minus 8%"" is still an outperformance to negative 28% YTD of VW. Congratulations.. you just outperformed by 20% YTD. || True, both Volvo and Polestar could be considered Chinese in this context. || I don’t think they make a lot of money, and that’s the issue they having now and are forced to cut plants and staff. They’re heavy in debt and moving forward they’ll cut dividends at all (in an attempt to recover). || The 2025 Explorer was supposed to be full electric, built in Oakville Ontario plant.  All the tooling was made and near production.  Apparently there was major issues with the drivetrain/electronics.  Now it's being delayed 2 years and redesigned for either full hybrid or phev.  I'm not sure which way, they are being tight lipped about it.  Even my friend who works in engine division there doesn't know. || They consistently make a profit and the stock price means that I can buy that profit cheap. Sure profit is down and that sux, but there is still profit. And personally i like their cars both ev and regular. They are reasonable cars at reasonable prices. I did buy in too early, but i still have some faith in the company and my investment. I am also tempted to buy more, but i have a set of rules that govern my investments and they prevent me from putting more money into that company at present. || Very interesting news. I asked specifically about full hybrid because here in Europe as well, manufacturers are rushing into it to bring down the average CO2 emissions of their cars. Starting doing electric cars from scratch seems like a huge headache for most old manufacturers || The automakers like EV because it's cheaper for them to make as many components are eliminated.  No more oil pumps, valves, pistons, engine blocks...etc...but the battery tech/infrastructure is still in its infancy.  I think the Explorer EV is available in Europe but it was a different version compared to north america.  Hybrids are one step towards lower emissions.  My friend has a toyota cross and gets 4l/100km.  Another had a honda accord and gets about the same fuel consumption. || Yeah the Explorer EV in Europe is basically a rebadged Volkswagen ID.4. It took forever for the assembly line in Germany to start, so many issues, and now of course the car is already outdated and they're planning many layoffs (they replaced the Ford Fiesta assembly line for the Explorer, volumes are really not the same...) || Ford is so silly.  The fiesta was probably a good seller as well.  The factory where Ford was going to do the Explorer EV was building the Edge and Lincoln Nautalis.  Not big sellers but steady.  They shut the plant down to convert to EV.  Now the plant is being converted again to build Ford Super Duty trucks and people will have being laid off close to 2 years.  The government and Ford was all happy to push the EV movement but not quietly shifting back to a gas guzzler truck, which is Ford bread and butter. VW is having same issues, they backed off on all-on on EV and pushing PHEV.  They need to keep working on EV tech, that is the future, less costly.  PHEV are cool but it's just adding more crap to a ICE || I personally don't like PHEV, they're powerful yes, and can in theory get good mileage, but they're so flawed in real life use."
Curious what everyone in this sub thinks of MSTR?,"Opinion varies by sub - they guys in MSTR think its going to pump like crazy soon. I'm just curious what you guys think as stock and trading experts.

Why would you buy the stock of a company whose only goal is to purchase an asset, when you can buy the asset itself? || "" they guys in MSTR think its going to pump like crazy soon.""

Go to any stock specific subreddit and all you're going to hear it how great the company is. || Slots are that way 👉 /wsь || I know a tulip when I see one.  Doesn’t mean you can’t make money off it.  Just know one day it’s gonna sink. || Let’s see…from the recent lows Bitcoin went up roughly 5x and MSTR went up roughly 25x. But yeah, MSTR is going to pump SOON, definitely hasn’t pumped already. || I've made quite a bit of money with MSTR and COIN over the past 10 months. In my opinion, stay away from MSTR (both really). Your risk/reward of buying is strongly skewed to risk at this point.

There's no fundamental reason for MSTR to have the evaluation it has. It's just been fueled by crypto-related speculation. Which is why I bought it, because I expected it. However,  crypto has boom and bust cycles. While it is currently in the boom phase, the bust typically comes quickly. When it does, I would expect MSTR to bust as well. Buying Bitcoin is not a business strategy. || I truly believe we are a few iterations apart of MSTR's convertible bonds creating a shitstorm like 2008's credit default swaps. || Could pump to 1000 or dump to 100. Worth buying if you’re young and a gambler. || Boomer's don't like it and neither does Cramer. That's all you need to know. || Not a scam, but an unnecessary premium cost to purchase the stock while attempting to profit off of bitcoin’s returns.

Doesn’t even make sense at all given the price:assets they manage. 

Buy BTC instead. || MSTR is borrowing billions at 0% interest through convertible debt offerings to buy a asset appreciating at 50% a year. To simplify things they sell a out of the money call option and if the strike doesn't hit 4 or more years later depending on the particular terms of the bond the buyer of the bond gets the principle back. 

The companies buying the bonds short the stock after the bond is bought so they don't care which way the price of MSTR stock moves. They just want it to be as volatile as possible because they can make money each direction.

 The bonds are the best performing bond on the market. When compared to most other bonds that are guaranteed to have a negative real rate of return it becomes a pretty good deal. Many people will hate MSTR but look at these companies alternatives. Buy bonds that pay out 5% in a currency expanding at a rate of 7% a year. 

This is why I like MSTR because the alternative for most bond buyers is to take a guaranteed loss every time. Some people will still say it's a PONZI without really knowing what the word means. Do you really think the largest insurance agencies in the world would dump billions into a crypto Ponzi? They are smarter than you and have spent more than 15 minutes doing research. || I had a look at what services they provide, aside from buying bitcoin, they don’t seem to do anything much of substance or significance. I’d rather buy BTC directly. || Ponzi || Saylor has already lost billions before, he'll sure as fuck do it again || Michael Saylor makes Bill Hwang look responsible and Bernie Madoff seem honest by comparison. || MSTR’s core business is getting overshadowed by its Bitcoin holdings. It’s tough to see real growth without Bitcoin keeping up. || I think the next recession will be caused by the collapse of MSTR. || Mstr is equal to 2-3 times more than Bitcoin. Mstx is equal to 4-6 times more than Bitcoin. If you don't buy Bitcoin directly and want a higher bar, mstx is a better choice. || On paper it seems irrational but its just market forces. MSTR went up because:

1.) $2Trillion bond market wants BTC exposure

2.) Many European countries BTC is basically illegal (no ETFs, bank will close your account) but you could still buy MSTR for BTC exposure. MSTR is still the closest equivalent to an ETF for these accounts

3.) You can put MSTR in European or Foreign retirement accounts

4.) As it ticked up in valuation from buying BTC with all this capital, market has started to price in S&P 500 & Nasdaq entry. This means MSTR has access to even more capital

5.) Saylor is quite bad at timing his buys, but it doesn't matter because BTC is up a shit load since he tripled down on buying it.

6.) Irrationality and traders buying momentum due to recent price moves.

So i've got 1 factor that isn't ideal (point 6) and 5 that are still true. I think if you aren't European or investing in retirement accounts or running a bond or pension fund, then MSTR isn't for you. BUT it trades based on the underlying so your opinion on MSTR should be based on your opinion on BTC. Most of reddit hate BTC hence the sentiment knocking around. MSTR doesn't need to have fundamentals or do anything special, providing exposure to Bitcoin is all it needs to do. || Thats a good investment of you willing to wait for a year or two.

sounds amazing! || How is it a Ponzi scheme?

>Why would you buy the stock of a company whose only goal is to purchase an asset, when you can buy the asset itself?

Personally I buy and keep my crypto myself but for less technical people it's not that accessible. People might want to hold their assets in tax sheltered accounts that don't allow crypto. || Because he is actively raising money to purchase the asset.

Look at how many BTC they had last year and how many they have this year. || I second this || Why do you think that? || And reddit doesnt like it either. Seems like a trifecta of near success || Hearing mstr has debt free bonds to buy bitcoin when there is an incoming trump admin is all i needed to know || saylor is shorting the entire financial market || I don't believe you will sell. || Mentioning retirement accounts on an international subreddit is not a reason to purchase. In scandinavia (where i’m currently settled), i have to tax around 37,84% on capital stock gains, no matter what, whereas BTC would classify as a forex and therefore go under a taxation of 22%.

And okay, they took out a loan and now have 40b in btc, but the company is worth 90b, while their strategy is based on getting returns off BTC itself. You’re paying a premium for absolutely no positives.

You can literally go BTC and gear it with 3x, it would be equivalent in theory, with a 3x hedge guarantee. But MSTR is a 3x premium, without the guarantee of a 3x hedge on profits.

How do you explain that? || If you believe in Bitcoin buy Bitcoin. What is the point of owning MSTR shares?

Personally I try to avoid ""Superstar CEO"" companies.

If I want indirect exposure to Bitcoin I will buy $BLK OR $IBIT. || This argument is straight up delusional. So you’re hoping for the next person to pay a dollar to buy 30 cents worth of bitcoin when MSTR issue shares so that your current ownership goes up slightly? You’re basically taking future buyer premium to divide to existing owners. What does that sound like? || It's not the only double in this market though, not about to chase the trade || Tax free, retirement accounts. || And why would you not buy an ETF on Bitcoin?

>How is it a Ponzi scheme?

Self explanatory really. || So if the asset price drops, not only is the company down the loss of asset price, but it also is in a hole of debt that would induce bankruptcy unless the asset price goes back up. || Let me ask you again, why would you buy the stock of a company that buys the same asset that you could buy yourself? And the company is raising debt to fund those purchases. || So?  || I’m being sarcastic… || why not? || Early 2024 : 15b btc 30b market cap

In the UK and other parts of the world you cannot buy btc etfs, MSTR is your only option || Alright buddy, we see btc going to 1m a coin, we like the stonk and it’s in our tax free accounts, that’s all I’ve gotta say. || True. I just pointing out one can’t predict in certainty on which direction this ticker will move at this time. || There is an etf what does that have to do with anything. || good point. I guess using options on MSTR is also a valid use case || >why would you not buy an ETF on Bitcoin?

They're not available everywhere and MSTR existed first. We can't buy US-domiciled ETFs in the UK for example.

>Self explanatory really.

Not really, unless you mean all of BTC, which is not clear from your posts. || Tax free, retirement accounts. || some people love diluted shares!

MicroStrategy has diluted its shares to raise capital in recent years. Since 2020, the number of outstanding shares has increased significantly, with reports of an 83-85% rise over three years. This was primarily due to continuous stock offerings and convertible debt strategies used to fund its aggressive Bitcoin purchases and operational needs. For instance, in the past year, shares increased by over 35%, indicating substantial dilution. || I know I'm being a little dick'ish, but the fact there are people who read your post and didn't immediately see the sarcasm is... alarming. || Ooh haha, good || Hes basically saying there wont be a new ATH || So their marketcap is now even higher compared to their assets than previously. This is NOT a good thing when they can’t consistently make money off the asset continiously by just «holding».

This is not your moms retirement account, this is the stock market, a place where people pay premiums on companies that have strategic implementations to make continiously growing cash flows. Why the fuck wouldn’t you just you BTC itself? || I wish I got in early on a ponzi too bro || If bitcoin price go up a bit, the convertible bond never happened.  And it is actually beneficial since you are leveraged a bit.

If bitcoin price go up a lot, the bond is converted to share.  So in the end, you are buying regular bitcoin for 3x preminum for no reason.  

If bitcoin price tank.  It is actually quite dangerous because you still have debt.  And the value of the company could go close to 0.

Actually quite interesting what the company is doing.  I think the main thing is mstr convertible bond price is quite high.  672$ by 2029.  If the price go up that much.  No one cares, everyone is rich. || Many countries such as the UK cannot buy those ETFs. MSTR is the only way for tax free btc exposure || yeah I get it, but I just want to hear the reason why he thinks that. There is a pronounced accumulation of capital by institutions in both BTC and MSTR. Predominantly, analysts project that BTC will ascend to $100,000 by the EOY. Such a milestone is anticipated to be followed by a corrective pullback. Nevertheless, if BTC attains this projected value, it would concurrently precipitate a new all-time high (ATH) for MSTR. I am not saying that subop is wrong - I just want to hear his take on it, because to me, it’s a clear bullish flow, and trimming the position now would be a shot in the foot. || I started investing in them at 20b market cap when their btc was around 10b, so I paid DOUBLE their book value for btc, can you believe that!? I paid 1 dollar for every 0.5 of btc! Unbelievable right..

Well I’m kinda glad I did that, because now you see their book value btc is worth DOUBLE the marketcap that I bought the stock at, 40b.

Are you starting to understand yet? One day not so soon, they will have 90b in btc, and so on.

Source: 300%+ ytd, tax free. || The trick is getting OUT early! || I’m already up 300%, we believe the price will go to 4000, that’s roughly a 10x from here to a 1 trillion marketcap, we like the stonk || And how are they able to buy the BTC? They issue debt. Debt has to be paid back either as cash or convertible to stock. They don’t make money. When BTC starts dropping again they won’t be able to issue debt to keep buying. When the debt is then to be repaid in cash (because the convertible price won’t hit) where does the money come from?

Why do you think MSTR is basically only able to issue debt and buy BTC during massive bull runs? Why weren’t they buying as aggressively when BTC was down 75% at $16-$20k? It’s because they couldn’t issue debt and they have no money. || Try that on all your investments and see how it’ll end up. Your argument for MSTR’s valuation is that you bought it, made money, and that’s why it’s worth purchasing?

A lot of people have done that, with way way way way more stupid shit. MSTR is not a waste to invest in, but at the current valuation, it definitly is.

Yeah, your take makes a lot of sense. Please remind me about your investment strategy again when i’m finished with my Masters in Quantitative Finance in June next year! || i am not giving suggestions.  i am only giving fundamental analysis.  i dont know if stock will go up or down. || 0% || Yes the current valuation is certainly bad, I agree, if we freeze in time for eternity today. Equity is typically forward looking though.

Enjoy your study, although I couldn’t imagine thinking I’m some kind of big timer because I’m studying a degree, that’s a little funny, I imagine by the time you’ve finished your degree I’ll have made 7 figures with my MSTR shares, maybe I can employ you as my personal fry cook after your studies, let’s see ;) || I know, our fundamental analysis is we think nation states will start adopting it, we think it will go to 1m a coin, we think MSTR will be the largest holder of modern day gold, we think MSTR will be a trillion dollar company, we like the stonk || lol…are you under the impression that 0% means they don’t have to pay back the principal?"
difference between splitting large companies by FTC/DoJ  and collaborating companies,"Not sure is this is just obvious and a stupid question. But my confusion arises from the recent demand to split Google (example selling chrome or android). I understand this antitrust cases keep happening like i think it happened to Microsoft some years ago. But can't google sell its parts to a friend and still have continued access to whatever is needed.

For example, Musk seems to use X data to train models of xAI even if they are separate companies or uses Tesla employees to fix X stuff or spaceX stuff, it doesn't seem like the government stops companies from collaborating. 

What am i missing here ? i.e. by FTC/DoJ splitting, won't it just be a minor hiccup?

Be careful with that mindset. || I work for Canada's largest railway and in the last month I've seen loads of rivians coming being unloaded, never seen one until a month ago and now the storage lots full of the them || They won’t reached $100/share simply by manufacturing cars. 

They will need to license some software/battery/tech or something. || I don't know but I saw a Rivian R1S at a store in Iowa and that is a slick looking SUV. || sure seems like having the CEO of of a rival company working as the shadow president might be a massive risk || I definitely hope that it does one day. I'm in for 1500 shares. Been holding since early 2023 off the crazy dip.

Here's hoping they know something we don't. In the third quarter they reported a loss of around 1.05-1.08(can't remember). They missed projections yet are keeping their targets. Cant remember but i think arkund 46k vehicles. For any other company, that would be considered promising.

I believe they just announced a loan from the DOE for around 6 billion or at least a ""promise."" This is going to support their construction of new plants in Georgia. Still 3 years before it opens. I dont think the DOE would give that type of commitment off of hope and prayers. 

I would look at why Canaccord Gemuitu has maintained a buy rate. Apparently they have good reasons.

Edit: Canaccord Genuity...dumb ass smart phone touch. Lol. || Unless rivian and vw can figure out how to make an electric car for less than they sell one, neither will be in business much longer. || it is a fine car except low volume is not what the investor hoped. || I'll venture to say Rivian hits $4 before it hits $100. || RIVN makes a good product and I believe the R2 and R3 will have huge sales.  However, RIVN hasn't proven they can be profitable. || -0-------0-

No || Lets put the thing on numbers. 

Rivian has 1 billions share outstanding and 11 B market CAP. 

Rivian needs to do 1 billion net profit for having EPS= 1$ and a P/E = 10. 

Rivian finished 2023 with -5.3 billion profit. The last quarter they lost 1.6 billion. 

If Rivian keeps going in this way they will disappear that is the reallity that RIVIAN is facing at the moment. 

  
For going to $100 they will be around 100 Billion market cap that would be 2.5 times Volskwagen market CAP, so I tell you know, forgot about it. The price now is around fair price for me and that is taking in count massive growth next years. || Call options would be your best bet on that highly improbable gamble. || lol good one ||  I'm a big Rivian fan.  The vehicles are sharp.  They are everywhere here in the NE.  IMO they have the clearest road ahead with 0 real competition in a small normal looking EV truck or SUV.  Can they stay afloat long enough,  can they avoid a catastrophic mishap,  can they leverage more OEMs to work with and kearn from the way they did with F.  There are certainly risks.  And I don't know about 100.  But I feel like it's the safest long term EV play since Tesla || I think the investments and doubled down investments in rivian will be tripled down to see them make it through otherwise it spells great trouble for more than just rivian and their seed investors. However I don’t think rivian will be a formidable EV auto company in the market anytime soon but then again the market is irrational. That being said 100/share would be crazy for them since they’re just a luxury adventure EV auto company and basically not much more. Sure they had the Amazon delivery van deal but aside from that they don’t currently  generate enough organic demand from the market to sustain the prices of their models especially at the volume they need to produce them in order to achieve profitability || My issue with Rivian is their market. Cars are depreciating assets and while sure most Americans are morons with their money most Americans also know they can’t afford a $80,000 EV. If Rivian can release a desirable vehicle that isn’t garbage for around $30,000 a year then I think you see a big jump in valuation, but until then it just seems like premium product limited to a premium audience. || Not with Musk in charge with that little Doge thing he and Trump made up. He's about to fuck every competitor in any market he's involved in. || Lol all the woke dumbasses trying to hard to make tesla less popular. These people really have not to much going on day by day || Based on the number of Rivian's I am seeing on the road in the last 12 months shows California's are saying FU to Elon/Tesla and buying Rivian.

Not that it means a lot, but in general, CA purchases often sets an example of what you can expect to see be purchased nationally the following year.

By that logic, Rivian will be something watch close and a buy around this March for me unless I see and hear a reason to pick it up sooner.

It has a lot of upside and if it looks like it will meet or exceed it's 2025 projections then I will buy as much as I can get my hands on. || Based solely off vibes, have to imagine a lot of people who hate Trump will never buy a Tesla now. However, Trump could possibly pass laws that are solely in favor of Tesla too. Not sure how, but I’m sure Elon is going to try.

I see rivian cars everywhere in California now, but that doesn’t mean they’ll ever be a profitable company. || I’m a big bull. If you model out Rivian actually making it, DCF would put today’s price at 30-50. The current price heavily discounts the risk of Rivian not making it. When R2 finally ships, the Georgia factory has broken ground and Rivian can show consistent gross margin positive sales… this stock likely will be trading at $100. || That is a pretty generic question. Could it reach $100? Yes, there are scenarios but they would be many years away or the result of a favorable acquisition (i.e., not a fire sale). Do you need a 10x return to warrant investing a few $K? || They have made moves in the pay few quarters that made me think they'll be around long enough for R2 to see daylight, GA factory operating, but R3 and $100/share feel like dreams now || 100% || I pay more attention to market cap than stock price when considering a future price. You’re basically asking do you think Rivian would make it to $100B market cap. It’s very possible if they continue to make great cars, people buy them, they get market saturation, etc etc. So big mountain to climb but could go there. I have an R1T. I absolutely love it and the company culture. And I can tell you from first hand experience they are making on the ground efforts to work out inefficiencies, and in a very smart way. || The way elon is about to fuck with that company... || That would make it over 100b valuation. Thats same as BYD. Toyota and Ferrari is around 80s and most others like vw or ford is around 40. I really doubt 100 but if they get enough volumes which they might id imagine 40 50 bn which would translate to 40 per share if you’re very bullish. || No. It would be foolish to invest in Rivian when their rival Tesla has a personal seat next to the president || No car company will get to $100. Tesla is just also a car company, and that bubble  will burst someday . || Yes. Rivian can become a 100 billion dollar company.  Everyone i have talked with thats owns a Rivian is absolutely in love with it.  The R1 just won Topgear award. R3 just won Esquire design award.  

Rivian is the second company in the western world to build software defined vehicles. || Just create an alert that triggers if Pelosi buys it. || Just buy in... and keep adding over time... Don't go crazy full portfolio type of shit, keep your risk manageable. || $12 means nothing. It’s a 12.5B market cap for a company losing billions each year. How do you think that’ll work out? || No. They’re literally riding the thin line. || I would even doubt they are able to hit the promised price and delivery date for the r2 (coming in 2026, not exactly next year) at $45k. There are so many unknowns between politics and inflation that committing to a price that early is a huge red flag. No CEO - rivian ford or tesla knows how much parts are going to cost them in 2026. The fed barely knows if it’s going to need to cut rates in January 

The cheaper car is for 2027, and I’m sure they added the maybe non existent EV rebate into that price 


Let’s say CA does give rebates to only rivian, and they’re able to somehow pass that in court, you think the stock with just keep doubling with 49 other states not milking their  state tax payers to cover for a federal refund copycat? || No || They will when they reverse split. No chance otherwise! || not in next 4 years. || Absolutely No.
I don’t see enough demand for Rivian products and next year will be very difficult year for Rivian. || Top signals breaching their heads || I bought 70 shares @ 10 || I bought some shares two days ago. I’m hopeful for the future, but hard to say cause aren’t they losing money on like every car they make? || Matter of time || just because there’s a lot of rivians on the road doesn’t mean the stock is fair value || They have yet to make a vehicle that turns a profit… || No || As long as they meet expectations, grow revenue, and expand in the EV market, they'll get to $100. If you like the company and are confident in their future, I suggest buying LEAPS for exponential profits. || After a reverse split or two? Sure || While I’m a large Rivian holder it’s comical you think Rivian will be coming out with a 35k car next year! Let’s get real. || they still lose money on each car, without counting overhead. with the tax credit being killed off idk how anyone can see this as a servicable investment. Been holding short since 30, i can still see it go lower || No but I think they can get to $20 over the next 12 months which is a huge return, but with a huge risk too || Love seeing Rivians on the street. But the charging infrastructure for EVs is still not solid, even in California. Tesla pushed home charging stations and they are not ridiculously priced. I hope I am wrong, but I think they may lose momentum for a while. || Intriguing. I just started seeing them. || I'll say very likely no but if yes it will take a faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr longer period to get there than most people today would have the patience for and for everything to go all sorts of right over *years.* If you're looking at where it was and asking if it could get back there, the question imo is whether it should have been there in the first place. I think they were lucky to be able to raise the kind of money they did at that insane valuation. || I own RIVN and think it has a lot of both upside and downside potential.  It’s just too early to tell but if it can be a top 3 player in the EV space long term I think we will see a 10x market cap increase over time.. whether that time Will be 5 years or 30 years I’m not sure.

Also I stiffes suggest always consider market cap not share price.  10M, 100M, 10B… you want to know how many shares outstanding.  It makes a difference in terms of whether you’re getting a fair deal or not.

RIVN - $12B market cap
TSLA - $1T market cap
LCID - $6B market cap
F - $44B 
GM - $61B
HMC - $39B
STLA - $38B || I wanna believe it. I like the products, and I still have a reservation on the R2.

But this stock had been in the single digit before, if you think $12 is “attractive”, and the company is still bleeding huge amount of cash and profitability is nowhere in sight.

I used to have 1000 shares but eventually sold it all. The world is littered with companies that put out wonderful products but never make a dime in profit. || The R2’s and R3’s will be the catalyst. If the market likes those, Rivian will be selling everything they can build because the prices are pretty attractive. If not…they’re going to need a recovery plan. They can’t exist on $100k+ EV trucks and delivery vans infinitely. || Vivek Ramsey just tweeted that he will be reviewing the grants/subsidies given to Rivian during the Biden administration.

I agree with you and bought some, but then I saw this tweet and it has me worried.

Your thoughts? || Elon is messing with Rivian in his new government role. || Absolutely.

The firm is a case study in product focus.

They’ve focused on their product to the degree other large mfgs want to use it, and in vws case, partnering with rivian seems to have saved them a lot of money given their previous efforts and failures.

It is my belief that a product centric focus will naturally lead to market share. Customers really don’t care if you’re a full blown nazi or whatever, if the product is a step change better than alternatives it will sell.

I think that’s why Elon keeps reacting to rivian news. He knows that the market share gained by rivian will be his loss and that his product no longer holds the step change. || This company had an Incredibly weak start, and that was before the world’s largest electric company CEO became the First Lady. This stock is a great short candidate. || Sure hope so || 100/share = 100b market cap. Which would make them the 3rd largest car company in the world. Can they become the 3rd largest car company in the world? Maybe but they won’t do it by just selling cars. Ev market is competitive as well as going out of style and while I’m an investor in Rivian I’m also realistic || They are debt laden with over 6 billion in debt. They are losing money steadily. Do they or will they have a product that can significantly increase their market share? Tesla is always the example people give but Tesla has done well because they were early but now the electric market is full of choices. Every manufacturer is making electric models now which makes it even harder to break in and gain market share. 

For rivian, they are going to have to continue to take on more debt and/or dilute with more shares. But they have delivered 42k vehicles so far this year, 47k total last year. It would be shocking if they made it to $50/share so I would  think $100 a share is just never going to happen. || I own it through Amazon || Idk they just had to get $6 billion loan from the government to finish a plant not a good sign. But what do I know stocks make no sense and the price will probably go up. || Rivian is so speculative to me,  they are losing so much money on vehicles.  You have to believe they will get that sorted out and be able to scale the business to even invest in this company at all.

If you think this is the next Tesla you are wrong,  energy business, AI, autonomous, robotics on top of profitable EV business.  Rivian has a chance to survive I guess but I won’t go much further than that.  Just my opinion || It was when I first bought it 🤦‍♂️ || Some one might find a way to pump and dump it ( then you will have your $100 a share price) to make your dream come through. || No, I don't think so. RIVN will be closer to going bankrupt than it ever going to $100/share. || The problem with Rivian is 2 fold:

1) they build cars at a gross loss

2) they live in the same market as Tesla.

And before people start saying ""but Tesla's didn't make a profit for 16 years"", this is correct but at the same time wrong, for 2 reasons:

1) TESLA Didn't have to compete against...Tesla

2) Tesla has NEVER, and I repeat NEVER, sold a car at a gross loss, even in 2012, even not considering EV credits.

And the last point is the one that everyone is really missing about EVs.  For Tesla, it was ""just"" a problem of scaling, for Rivian, Lucid and every other western automakers the problem is that you are building a product that is structurally unprofitable.

To become profitable you have to change the culture and engineering of the company, literally the hardest thing for a company to do.

And you have to do this in an environment where another company is making 20% profit margin, has no debt, is faster than you, has more experience than you and it's creating the product ( robotaxy) that will make your product obsolete. || Yes buy all the shares you can! You won’t regret || Nah Elon will put a stop to that || Two people I know got rid of their Tesla and bought a Rivian  ! Cause of politics, so there’s that || Easy || It'll take Rivian expanding to more than just an electric auto manufacturer for Rivian to hit $100 in the near future. It's going to have to show some impressive software capabilities, too, and maybe some unique battery technology. I do believe they'll hit $100 eventually. I have accumulated a few shares that I've been buying for the past 3 years on a recurring basis, as well as a few leaps, betting that there would be at least two solid domestic EV producers, with TSLA being the other, once all is said and done. Also maintain a small stake in BYD. || The company would be bankrupt if it wasn’t for VW and Amazon. || No they don't make money, evs are money laundering tools || Rivian will make it to zero dollars a share given the incoming administration and the fact they lose tens of thousands on each car made || Rivian is a loser of a company. It has never been successful, they should shut down car manufacturing and become an IT company.  || Maybe in 5-8 years. They need better marketing, prices and ti make profit. || rivian saving vw?

you do realize that vs is more than the USA right? 

in the EU one out of every four cars sold is a VW group automobile || Not with Musk owning the US government. He will do his best to prevent any and all potential competition to his empire. || And Elon Musk (""DOGE Chairman"") is filing a lawsuit against the loan that the U.S. provided for Rivian. Careful.... Powerful people playing games. || VW is hedging their bets with Scout. || Reddit: everyone is selling Tesla and getting Rivian. 

Real world: Rivian 2024 Q3 revenue is 35% lower than 2023 Q3 revenue. || No $50 much realistic, if they get pumper musky on board then $500 is possible. || I’d be concerned with Musk having a position in government. He already said they’re going to be looking into the tax cuts they received and if they were appropriate. || Isn’t it safe to say you cannot compare to a company like Tesla that had al of elons ventures wrapped up into an inflated share price while also being a weird cult meme stock. Rivian is just rivian, all they do is auto manufacturing. Safer to compare it to ford || Yes || California don’t have that money btw unless our boi governor levy gas tax to $6 per gallon while the rest of US get below $2 when the new digging operation open, he would not last long || I don't believe they'll make it to net profitability, so not really no. Either going bankrupt or get bought at a significantly lower price than 100 per share || Sub $10 is my buy zone || There is only one Tesla, like it or not, Rivian just isn't a cult like Tesla. || Musk will do anything to stop Rivian.

Elon Musk’s DOGE partner Vivek Ramaswamy says they’ll scrutinize $6.6 billion Biden loan to Tesla rival Rivian.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-doge-partner-vivek-131329979.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-doge-partner-vivek-131329979.html) || Chinese tariffs should play out well for Rivian. NAC standards make it more appealing. Partnerships with VW should help.

Amazon delivery trucks in time will all be Rivian || All these facts are there but this stock doesn’t seems to go 100 . This EV market has lots of players. Nissan news of cutting production and Ford is not in good shape as well. || Elon is going to do everything he can with his new government influence to tank Rivian.  They are already talking about “investigating” current government loans to the company. || No || They just got big money for their factory from the Biden Administration so it's worth keeping an eye on. || Selling cars is not why Tesla is valued the way it is. Rivian would need some serious progress in self driving AI and other monetizeable software. || Rivian is an auto company that hopes to make money some day. It is not Tesla. || In short, no. In long, absofuckinglutely not. In my opinion Rivian has no future unless they can actually sell their own vehicles. They’re not a holdings company, the stock price isn’t going anywhere based off their dealings with VW. If they can’t sell *their own* vehicles then they’re going nowhere but down. They had a cool concept for a truck but they’re selling it for $70,000-$100,000. Who the hell can afford that? There’s not enough people interested in electric over-landing who are also rich and like rivians. It’s such a niche vehicle, they can’t sell it to working men, families, construction companies, etc because it’s too expensive and doesn’t suit an everyday need. 

These are just my observations on a surface level. Take it for what you will. || Unlikely || Rivian hitting $100 per share is a big jump from where it is now. The company has challenges like losing money, tough competition, and needing to grow fast. It has potential, but getting to $100 will take a lot going right. It’s a risky bet, so it’s good to stay balanced with other investments. || Government picking winners and losers. Apparently government has picked rivian to be a winner. || I don’t think so.  They got a long ways to go for that to happen. || Living In Canada and I’m a truck driver. I see the Rivian suv daily now. Based in Ontario btw || Isn't rivian like among the worst in reliability and struggling financially?

Edit: Just checked, depending on the source jt has roughly a 50% chance of bankruptcy in the next 2 years and most are saying 2025 || I would say no. I think a good way to estimate its potential is look at an established global company’s market cap and compare to theirs. Mercedes is $60B. Rivian is $12B. So MB is 5x or so than Rivian so $60 is realistic. 

Obviously stocks don’t necessarily work like that but I would think the 10 year plan could approach that market cap. Rivian has a long way to go to get to MB’s market penetration too || Elon musk is gonna use the white house to squish any real competition to tesla. They will be lucky to still be a company in 4 years || Litecoin (LTC) || Maybe in five years if they get their act together. || I got my one share betting it will go to 100/share! || With Musk in a position of power…I dunno. || Elon is going to do everything he can within Trump’s government to destroy Rivian || Yes. After the 10 to 1 reverse split || If there's a short squeeze /s! Quick! Make some ""technical analysis"" DD so the apes can throw their paychecks to pump 'em bags! 

That's before RJ decides to fire up the stonk printer like Ryan Cohen, Adam Aron, and Mullen did! || It’s a long way to go || For me, I buy stocks in the products I love… and friends and family want for themselves. Done deal. I buy a hold. I don’t get swayed by good or bad news. For me, it’s all about the product and vision. || There are many companies that have become examples of bad management. When I have to name one, Rivian is the first to come to mind. We’re talking about a company with a negative FCF of $15b over the last 3 years, which would probably have gone bankrupt had it not been for the Volkswagen deal and the loan announced this week (let’s not forget the insider trading on these two pieces of information, which should have remained confidential before they were officially announced). 

The CEO had the audacity to state that they were maintaining their guidance for the next financial release, namely a profit. It’s a lie at this level. This company is overvalued, and we hope it will reach its true value (close to $0 a share). || If they're extremely successful in the next 5 years, 60-200B would be a reasonable valuation, depending on level of success. That would mean $60-250 share price, basically. Company is worth $12B right now, which feels like a bargain based on the upside. Hard to imagine them totally collapsing after the VW deal but even if they don't do well, seems hard to imagine they'd drop below $10B, so looks like room for it to run IMO. || Uhm... look at LUCID and ask yourself the same question. Great vehicles, but... || I bought it at $119 so $12 is relatively low. YWSYLS || A better question is do you think investors want to put 88 billion into rivian. Which is what it would take to reach 100 a share. || When you look at Rivian, don't think about comparing it to Tesla, compare it to stocks like Ford, GM, HMC. These are actual car brands and will give a relative feel for how that market does. Which isn't great and pretty flat becuase it isn't an ever growing margin sector of retail, more like the opposite where the margin is shrinking and they are finding more ways of making money. Like through parts sales, but the weakness of parts availability has been clearly exposed and the entire industry has taken a hit from it. Better to invest in something like CoPart, where they make money on used sales/auctions rather than trying to build a brand from the ground up. Look at CoPart or Carvana although I personally think atm carvana is the most overvalued stock on the entire stock market. 

If caravans market cap is what the stock value says it is, they would need about 20 million cars on hand in inventory for their numbers to make any sense. Their current PE is a hilarious 13k.

Short answer is NO. || There isn't a 35k Rivian coming out next year for starters... || You lost me at Rivian saving VW.  Better looks carefully at  Rivians numbers and how many cars they need to sell at 35k to make a.profit.  They are losing money on everything they sell as is everyone in the US except Tesla. || Biden administration just gave them a $6 Billion dollar loan. Not sure how that plays out. || Not ever again. It is three years from bankruptcy. Might be a good short. || no one outside of the Subaru Outback infested northeast would think twice about looking at a Rivian. Midatlantic folks don't want big cars. Flyover meat eaters don't want their big car to be an EV. Canada and Vermont are not gonna make this a $100/share company. || Not likely. The market cap is already very high. They need to start making some money. || Rivian is valued significantly higher for what they are than pretty much every car maker that isn't Tesla.  Eventually people are going to have to realize that EVs are still cars and the companies making them will eventually be valued like other car makers. || No || That would put them around 100 billion market cap, 3rd in the world behind Tesla and Toyota.  That's a lofty goal but who knows. || You are misinformed.

VW doesn’t need saving. Rivian does. Which is why Rivian was forced to sell a huge chunk of their equity to VW for cash.

Rivian burns $1.5-2 Billion per quarter. $6-8B per year. They have just $6.7B in cash.

At this rate, they will have to issue massively dilutive stock within 1 year to raise more cash to fund operations. If you buy today, expect to be diluted. || Now that trump
Is in and Elon is on his team no. If anything I’d short it. || RIVN could make it to $100 and could also make it to $2. If it dips below $10 before EOY, I plan on buying shares. || Definitely if they do revers split. They just need to fill the form and submit to Nasdaq for 10:1 revers split to make $100+ for now. || Hahahahaha || Only if the company survives the next four years. || Here’s where I think we’re at with this stock: if rivian can manage to stop losing money on their individual sales (aka actually produce good earnings) the stock will dramatically increase. On the other hand, the EV tax doesn’t exclude rivian, and they can’t turn profitable soon enough to survive (the stock poops itself down to $5) || R2 comes out in 2026... || I think you should stay away from rivian especially with the new team in the center and the threat of investigation || Rivian saving VW? LOL. Its the entirely other way around . Rivian is highly in debt and VW just gave them breathing room with $5bln || Sure! It will go to $100 if you go all in! Just like the Intel genius that invested $700k in Intel! /s

Don't forget to say ""I just like the stock!"" || Rivian is a dogshit in this moment. || Not a fan but doesnt really have anything interesting from the company || I am interested in this stock. It has massive potential. But within the next 4 years? Not sure. One thing for sure is that if Trump imposes tariffs next year it will be a bad time to be holding Rivian stock. It also doesn’t help that the incoming administration is against EVs. There’s basically so many risks on the horizon that I would not touch it atm || How can you even invest in this company. || lol Rivian needs to learn to build a car for less than they sell it….. || I will be shocked if Rivian doesn't go bankrupt. Every quarter they are posting over a billion in losses and they don't seem to be making a ton of headway. Rivian is not Tesla 2.0. || No. || No || [deleted] || Yes, at IPO. || Yes - after a 100 to 1 reverse split when the stock falls to a dollar and they dilute the shit out of it to save the company. || Yeah, I bet it could hit $10000/share according to your in-depth analysis. I would throw the majority of my life savings in Rivian. I see so many of them on the roads. || The auto industry is notoriously hard to break into for a reason.

A product can look fancy, but it takes a monumental amount of continued investments to sustain. Even Tesla is barely profiting, and not from selling cars, but from selling carbon tax credits. || NOPE || No. Bankruptcy soon || Will feel better to be wrong but I highly doubt it as Rivian lacks any clear roadmap for profitability and growth. Return on its assets, return on its equity and gross margins are all worsening. || Seems like the winner here is going to be Volkswagen. || No. || How many missed deadlines and dilutions to keep the lights on will it take for you to see this is going to zero.  They were supposed to break even by Q4 24 based on savings and model revamp bla bla bla, Is that going to happen?  Nope excuses delays and more losses...  But don't worry the Saudis will buy more shares to keep the dream alive...  What happens when  they say nah its not worth the trouble to employ 1000 people?? || They look like incredible vehicles. But at the rate they burn through cash, plus the sluggish EV market… I would expect Rivian stock to go to zero before it goes to $100.

Tesla is a tech company. Rivian is just an auto manufacturer with none of edge that established manufactures have. They lose money with every vehicle they sell. For those of you that own one, arent you afraid of them going bellow up? || No tesla owner is turning in for a Rivian. || Flip that around and look at Nvidia. I agree. || Hi, genuine question, it is 90% low all time, is that still the case? || But if it’s high like Tesla it’s still not high enough. I’m tired of these narratives. || Right, depends on number of outstanding shares, total market cap, then compared to earnings/share ratio, etc. || I realized this with Ford a long time ago || You didn’t really address any of the catalysts in the OP. It’s not like they said “low = undervalued” so what you said is basically a platitude with no context.

An affordable EV SUV with industry backing and a relatively paltry market cap for the underlying relative to the competition is, in its own right, a very bullish vacuum to exist in.

One good earnings call and it’s going to go up considerably. 

Try breaking down those facts compared to its current valuation and you’ll be contributing something to the discussion. || can’t lose if you don’t sell || Being delivered to Canada? || [removed] || Remindme! One year.

Gotta come back and thank you. || [deleted] || They are doing that || hence why Volks put 5 billy into them || Well no they have to sell them. Other companies have been valued higher by just selling cars though...I didn't see why they can't. || I drive one. Best car I’ve ever owned. || They look awesome. || I personally don’t like the look, but I’ve heard that Rivians are very well built and great cars || How about the Lucid stock and ev cars ? || iowa mention. LFG. guess i’ll buy more || Looks like a truck for chicks. || Also, SUVs are mainly for the North American market and North America is very much behind with charging infrastructure compared to China And Europe. Outside North America, people prefer smaller cars. I have no doubt it's a good product, but it's just a small market and It is going to be like that for a while if we don't see a big push for EV infrastructure from the government. It just makes it difficult for Rivian to get big enough to reach economics of scale. What we are seeing with Elon pushing for the removal of the EV credits is to close the door behind for other EV makers to become established. || Only a matter of time before he pisses Trump off enough to get fired || He’s pissed off his largest buying demographic and is making himself a lot of political enemies as well, though. || What I believe matters is what can be offered.

What can Elon offer a southern state:

He has a car factory in Texas (and Germany) that is not at capacity. It does not seem like it would make sense for Tesla to open a second plant in the US south east coast, although I guess this is a viable option. Both plants that Tesla has that serves this area are under cap.

His social media company is losing money and I’m unsure what expansion it could provide.

His ai company has no product and seems to exist to interdeal with the car company.

His boring company has not had the success needed to encourage widespread projects.

His space company could expand to other southern states.

Then compare Bezos:

He can offer Amazon distribution facilities, Amazon data centers, Anthropic data centers, Blue origin facilities, etc on top of a rivian facility.

I don’t perceive that musk has the upper hand in any way. He can sit next to the president full time, but he doesn’t have the offer to move the needle. 

If anything, the threat of musk has forced bezos into the posture where strategic decision making is a focus. || This. || For America or RIVN? || Didn't they put Rivian execs as CEO of VW NA and the joint venture? It seems like the Rivian exec team is doing the shadow puppeteering unless I'm missing something. || Only if that CEO is a crooked psychopath and if the rule of law is taking a vacation || He should probably acquire them given that the cybertruck is junk. || Who's that? || But what’s going to happen if the incoming war against EVs happens with Trump and his best mate Elon coming into power again. 

Haven’t they been talking about shutting down all the EV plants etc || They lose approximately $32k for every vehicle they sell! || Their next lineup of vehicles are going to be a lot cheaper to produce. || The DOE financing the next plant worries me. Banks love finincing things like this and they saw the books and passed. Its also equally likly to be pulled as funded. || VW doesn't have the experience to design/make a good EV and to sell a good EV well || This is simply not true. The current lineup of cars starts at like $97,000. They absolutely make a profit on $100,000 cars that I see all over California. The problem is the initial capital costs for tooling, procurement, testing, then manufacturing to start a legit car company are insane. When Musk took over tesla they already had  that manufacturing, tooling testing and procurement already in place. Musk oversaw the much larger scaling of those factors to push out the model 3 which made tesla finally profitable.

If Rivian can put out the R3 and ramp production on it, they will turn the corner. Its gonna be a few years, but that car will sell well. || All they need are headlights that don't look idiotic and the whole car would be sleek, but alas. Anyways, I wouldn't buy stock in a company that loses money on every vehicle they sell and don't have the demand needed to reach the break even point (inventory levels are way too high even amid lower production for retooling) || That isn’t how it works.      

 VW, and all other legacy auto mfgs are sitting on 50 years of legacy debt and contractual agreements.     

The return on these investments has already occurred.         

The new entrants to the market do not have any of that debt or obligations.        

Instead they have the negative cash flow of establishing product and production systems. These things provide a future return on investment.        

To like…conceptually compare the market cap of vw to rivian and then suggesting that one would or would not be larger than the other is casually ignoring the 50+ years of debt and obligations.         It would be expected that if a new entrant were able to achieve scale and cash flow positive operations that their market cap would surpass legacy due to the absence of legacy transactions, debt, obligations.    

 This applies to any capital intensive vertical and any new entrant. Automotive is the most applicable as it demands extreme capital in order to achieve a return.   

To give some clarity: VW is serving over 200b of debt. Rivian is at 5b. If scale is achieved, the math favors rivian. Over time they build up legacy debt and the cycle continues. This cycle is why new entrants exist. || Except this analysis never works for ev startups ever. It’s not about numbers at all. || The only reason I know about Rivian is hearing it in this news. And seeing it at tysons corner mall in a showroom. After walking by i told my wife, what happens if you buy the car and the company goes under? || Agree. Small group of the population they are selling to. If a vehicle manufacture could produce a basic truck for the willing person, gas/ diesel or electric for around $30k new they would do great. The problem with electric vehicles is their charge/ towing capacity. Anyone who tows daily or anything heavy they are just not going to use an electric vehicle. || > seems like a premium product limited to a premium audience

What’s wrong with that?  RACE is the best performing automaker stock.  Look up what their car is and what volume.

There is money to be made in premium, low-volume, speciality vehicles.

I hope rivian recognizes that and finds their market with *sustainable* growth.  People expecting them to match Toyota sales volumes is not realistic or healthy.  

I would like to see them partner with someone who can deliver better production volume basically overnight, without the 5+ years and billions of costs doing a factory.

Take some automaker that’s flailing to have something popular or desirable, and is just wasting their factory capacity.  (VW, Stellantis, one of the many industrial builders who is floundering)

Let rivian take over a facility and some supply chain elements, and let them apply some new thinking and approaches.  Rivian would see the big and sudden production increase that investors have been waiting for.  The partner would get some life out of a wasting asset and could agree to share some of Rivian’s features or concepts. || R2 price is $45k || Yeah but if they can take the car and keep it along with doing other things w the company there could be an upscale on profit. Tesla seems like a ticking time bomb… although I do have 30 shades of Tesla from when it was at 108 / share || Just to play devils advocate a little bit - the biggest selling cars in America are all trucks that are $55k-100k depending on model and add-ons etc 

Whilst I personally don’t think EVs will ever really
become as widespread as combustion engines, I just can’t see them being popular enough. They’ll be plenty of them in the big cities but no-one in rural America will want these until there is a masssssive infrastructure investment, and it seems like the new government will do the opposite. || I don't think it'd fly with reconciliation which would be the only way since they don't control the Senate and they barely control the house, so even if they remove the filibuster, I feel like the House Dems would go at this like rabid dogs || That's just imagination and grandstanding. No sane person will base their decision on politics over the appeal of the car itelf for such a large purchase.

It's like saying those who hate Trump saying they wouldn't want to live under his rule. Yet I don't see airports getting more full. || The number of people who wont buy is balanced by the number of new people who will

Fellow rivn investor || Here's my model discounting back from 2030 to today which shows that it's trading a bit under what might be preset value.

Not going to be profitable, ever. || I predict 5+ years until they are making decent profit and minimum that or longer for $100 a share. And I honestly like the look of the Rivian’s versus Tesla. Though I’m too poor for either. || Software defined vehicle is such a nonsensical buzzword. If they don't even have a strong story around autonomous driving how can they claim to be a software defined vehicle? I'm a shareholder myself but I find that phrase ridiculous. Also not everyone wants their car to be a piece of software that is subject to the whims of the company, some people think a vehicle should be a durable or luxurious piece of equipment. Who wants to pay $80k for a piece of software anyhow??? People have come to expect software to be free or ad supported!! || Do you know where I can track her? I can not find her portfolio online || It would be interesting to see California taxpayers forced to subsidize manufacturing jobs in IL, GA & SC that would compete against the 22,000 manufacturing jobs at Tesla in CA. || Tariffs. Tariffs everywhere… || Lots of Tesla’s core (and richest) customers have started switching to Rivian. Plenty of demand. || My thoughts are that we used to be a country where a scam artist like Ramaswamy would have to worry about prison time while committing securities fraud in broad daylight.  He’s one timeline off from Shkreli. || Can’t disagree with things you’re saying.

But I like to imagine... what if Scaringe gets smart and acts like rivian is a startup that uses every dollar wisely and becomes obsessed with first profit.  Imagine if he takes this part shortage crisis and turns it into an opportunity, building his own micro supply chain to not just guarantee supply but slash cost.

Imagine then if that is announced and at the next ER they say this solution means they can get back to growth and forecast 100k units next year instead of 50k. 

Sure that’s a bit of an optimistic sequence of events, but it’s not really far fetched either.  

It’s the kind of narrative that sends RIVN back to $20.  

Next, imagine he does a smart strategic partnership with someone who has surplus factory and supply chain capacity, but moribund products and demands.  Rivian then leverages that for instant production ramp, no need to spend billions and wait 5+ years.  They just start ramping on a sustainable scale now, and let the mega factory build take whatever time it takes.  

Again, it’s an ambitious idea, but doesn’t require any miracles, just a bit of work.  That co-factory could add 5 or 6 digit production volume numbers without breaking the bank.

This two year strategic plan, if executed, could change everything.  Each move slashes the “loss per vehicle” metric dramatically, which seems to be something superficial markets have latched onto. || So Europeans would be more inclined to buy rivians then? || You mean like every start up ever ?  Profits come with volume.  It's really that simple. The trick is surviving until volume/profit curves collide || Literally what they’re in the process of doing with the R2. || Oh good not just me. People came at me when I posted about Rivians future and they are not making money. Plus more debt with new loan. ||  It of the car companies per share it’s low… it’s a company picking up and has foreseeable growth in not just one style of EV’s || Say that lol || The saudis? The post is about Rivian not lucid you have no idea what you’re talking about lmfao || Lol. || Can go down another 90% || There's a Peter Lynch saying about this: What do you call a stock that's down 90%? Answer, a stock that was down 80%, and then saw it's value get cut in half again.

Regardless of how much a stock is down when you buy it, the most that you can lose is 100% of the money you put into it. || I don't think you can count the all time high here. It ran crazy at IPO, during a time the market was crazier than it is now. I've followed this company since way before IPO and I'm not sure where they should be trading at. All you can do here is decide what your get out loss is before buying because so far, none of it run ups have ever held. Just my opinion and I love their vehicles, Good luck || Yes it is but that doesn’t mean that the stock 
isn’t at fair value or even over valued. Believe it or not, it can actually go lower even if it is at an all time low at this moment. || Look at a GOEV all-time chart || Thanks for educating me :) || Its worth 11 billion dollars as a company, and they lose around 50k USD for each car they sell || No, there’s such a thing as dilution. Look at market value not share price.

OP is basically asking if rivian will become 2.5 times as big as Ford. || Look at the market cap or a number of other metrics. Share price is pretty arbitrary and tells you very little about a company. Rivian at IPO was absurdly overpriced, blew up to even more absurdly overpriced, and imo never really dropped to what I would call a fair market price. That said, I'm buying shares because I'm not sure it will ever actually drop to where I'd like to be buying it and I believe they will achieve profitability and scale over time. || Literally. Tesla has been painfully overvalued for years now || Tesla also has the ear of the president, and is a stand in for the influence and power of one individual. || I simply addressed his “Rivian at $12 being low” as a misguided way of viewing a stock’s price. If you want to take a look at their balance sheet and do your own DD to see if they’re sitting at a fair value or not is up to OP decide. || Platitudes without context is the name of this sub lmaoooooo || I am very skeptical they are capable of making a 40k suv. || Yes they are being delivered in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, and Montreal || I think Mexico. || and selling in a new market.  Thats why OP has never seen one before. || I didn't count them but looked looked like roughly 1/4 of the cars in the lot were rivian. That's up from 0 a month ago || I'm not pumping anything.

|-|-|-|-| || That's true, most voting Americans are even dumber and more racist than most people predicted. || And do you think just VWs $5B is going to get them to $100/share? 

Hence why I said some, not just one. || I live in Bend, Oregon, and the amount of Rivians we have here convinced me to put 30k into its stock. My buddy has one and it’s a gorgeous ride. || Any reason you picked Rivian over a Tesla? || They do, just dont check their reliability ratings || I love their look. The boxy look is better than Tesla's teardop shape imo || Lucid looks like a 1990s Oldsmobile. I have no idea who actually wants those cars.

Rivian at least has a very unique look. || And support the Saudis .. fuck that || Charging infrastructure? Nothing is easier than charging at home. The US is far better situated for home charging.  || But do people prefer small cars outside of North America because of gas prices? I know that is a primary driver here in Germany. I think there would be plenty of market for a really well built EV SUV here in Europe || It's not hard to make smaller cars once you have the infrastructure. Also the R3 which is a smaller version is coming 2027

https://www.caranddriver.com/rivian/r3 || > North America is very much behind with charging infrastructure compared to China And Europe.

are you excluding Tesla chargers? || Biggest understated risk for TSLA stock right now imo || He also made his cars extremely popular with the right who are in power for the forseeable economic future. Then he is going to leave to launch rockets and appoint a nice middle of the road kinda guy to run it. 

Its a good situation politically if you ask me. || You’re forgetting that he has the advantages of being a drug addicted imposter and sociopath.  Surely that counts for something? || Doge father || No idea. I would like to wait and see if that even becomes a slight possibility IF I WERE ABOUT TO BUY. I'm speaking from an already bought and holding perspective, so it's not as great of a risk for me as someone who is JUST getting in. 

For me personally, I'm caught in the net either way at this point. Just a matter if I'm getting put in the display fish tank or getting skinned and fried. || This concept being the primary reason retail investors won’t invest is actually why now is the perfect time to buy the stock if you believe in the company’s long term success.

If you believe they will succeed then you’d rather buy the stock now than when they’re making money on every vehicle they sell. Don’t buy the news. || And ford lost billions on EVs || That figure includes a lot of the startup and initial manufacturing costs. 

They don’t literally lose 32k making the car, just factoring in all the stuff to get a car company producing vehicles, they lose that per vehicle || then they spend a billion dollars a quarter to lose that $32k per vehicle. just getting profitable on making and selling cars does not make them a profitable company, they need to sell enough cars to pay their four billion a year cost to run the company.  
  
the math is against them.  The R2/R3 won't save them as it will put them into a highly competitive market space. || R2 is their ModelY competitor. That needs to sell or you never see that cool R3 || debt is factored into profits, and despite the debt VW is still profitable (>1B quarterly) || Just because irrational investors made money in the past doesn’t mean they’re gonna do it again. 

How can you argue against a solid objective analysis in favor of the once in a lifetime to the moon scenario that is Tesla || >It’s not about numbers at all.

Say what? || The problem with a small vehicle is the small margins. || Rivian doesn’t need to get into the econobox market just yet.  A rivian basic SUV priced in the ballpark with peers like Toyota/Hyundai/Kia/Ford/gm, they’d have no problem moving 50,000 units which would represent a 100% growth rate and would trigger other capital investment and momentum. || [removed] || Bro Tesla is not just a car company. 

Why do you and others compare RIVN to TSLA?

Tesla has a massive breadth of products outside their cars. 

Rivian is not anywhere near Tesla.  || Sell those, it will revert back to the mean. Musk will either get tired of DOGE when it involves real work and not just tweeting, or Trump will get tired of Musk who seems to be now 24/7 near him (good he is only a part time CEO). TSLA is always one earnings call away from a huge correction, I hear no one in Cali is buying Tesla's again, any of those points could be the catalyst, add seasonality or a potential recession. The company has been performing mostly flat on an inflation adjusted revenue basis for many years now. || > don’t think EVs will ever really become as widespread as combustion engines

""ever"" is a long time... || I think the issue here is that people buying tesla (the lefties of California) are in fact, not sane lol || 2 years. || They will be FCF positive and pay down their debt. No different than what happened with Tesla. 

https://m.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/long-term-debt || Lol. Do some research on it.  The phrase has a very specific meaning. || If that was really the plan they would never actually say its the plan. 

This was a PR threat only. It wont last 5 mins in the legislature or the courts. || Lots of conservitive who would have never considered an EV are shopping Tesla now. The question is which side actually changes behaviuor. || You may know how many Rivian sold up to now. Next year would be no better than this year. Sorry for the reality. || That is a lot of imagination. I think the biggest hurdle is the market for electric cars. Almost half the people who have bought electric vehicles in North America say their next car will be an ICE vehicle and many of the people who have ICE vehicles now aren't overwhelmingly crazy about going electric. Add to that, Trump is going to remove the EV tax credit and it is becoming less an issue about production capacity and more about market desire. 

There isn't going to be another player enter the market and be the next tesla because when tesla did it, they had next to no competition. That Era is over and new players need to have something no else does, which rivian does not, or some gamechanging technology, which rivian does not. || People really do not understand the concept of fixed cost absorption. Saw all these same arguments in 2017 for Tesla and kept buying. Rinse and repeat here. || Ummmm sure…..go ahead and dump your money into them I see no way this could go badly || lol Tesla was able to make and sell cars at a profit 10 years ago…. || Yeah they been in the process for years…. || Say more || And after that another 90% || True, lower can always go lower. || Yeah Amazon isn’t letting that happen my friend || I don’t know why people post this and COMPLETELY forget that it took Tesla 12 years of producing cars to break even, losing billions per year and selling cars at a staggering loss….until it finally made it out.

Why would Rivian not be afforded the same runway? || So what? Most companies lose money to begin with. The *exact* same argument was made with Tesla for years in the early 2010s. Yet an amazing investment to buy during that period. 

Of course it can’t go on like that forever. But it can go on for a long time as long as they stay on track. || And? Lots of growth companies start out in the red, e.g. Amazon and Tesla, and Rivian is no exception. Does that mean it’ll eventually pull an Amazon or Tesla? No, of course not. There’s always a risk they don’t make it, but lack of profitability in the early stages of growth is far from abnormal. || [deleted] || Hey at least Tesla makes money and Rivian isn’t even near that.   Dilution is more plausible than pumping to $100 || You could say this about just about every member of the S&P before they were the “safe staple companies” you all love so much. Amazon, Apple, Google, all of them at one point “were painfully overvalued for years.” || What you said was rudimentary and didn’t address any other aspect of their thoughts.

I already did what you mentioned and more, it’s not really the point. 

Again you’re saying nothing. Obviously that’s for us to decide, lol. You still aren’t contributing anything.

There is no risk in sharing an informed opinion, you just don’t have one. || I feel like this tip is the blue collar insider trading tips we all need right now. Thank you 🙏 || Cool ehhh || I saw one in st. John's a few weeks ago || I am a Canadian EV owner here and haven't seen a single Rivian on the road. The only two options I can find on their website here cost over 100k, and neither are vehicles that I would want to drive. Maybe in the future when cheaper models come to the market, but right now these vehicles are not affordable for the vast majority of Canadians and there are already several equivalent luxury EVs at similar or lower price points. || I would consider Rivian's problem as not producing enough cars. But if Rivian's problem is not even have enough demand in the US, and has to reply non-US sales, that could be a bigger problem to Rivian || [deleted] || Amazing cars but I’m not sure they have a plan to profitability. || Recently moved back to Houston area to a suburb. I see a crazy amount of EVs all together but the Rivians are thick out here. || I wanted an actual roomy SUV that looked and felt like a real SUV and could do SUV things. It had be comfortable for road trips, light off-roading and camping, but also a capable daily driver. I also didn’t really feel like supporting Tesla because of Musk.

Also, very attractive lease deals on the 2024 quads at the time. || Care to elaborate? || Huh what?? Lucid Air look amazing! Rivian looks like a plastic toy. The lights are so ugly compared to the slickness of the Lucid.  

And apparently they have a much longer distance capability of like 500+ miles || Ironically being low key and unnoticeable can be a very desirable quality for someone dropping 100k on a car. || That market is pretty much tapped out. Many people rent or live in apartments. You're not getting country folk to buy EVs anytime soon. 

And yea, charging infrastructure matters. Are you confused? || They are far more expensive, going to cost more electricity bills, and more difficult to maneuver in dense cities. In Denmark, SUVs only make up 2-3% of all cars on the street. And pretty much been the same picture in pretty much all the European countries I have been to. For the most part, station cars are as big as they get in here in Europe.

Also, US SUVs are much bigger than European SUVs. || But that's only one of the reasons. Most European cities also deter people from driving bigger vehicles. Narrower roads, smaller parking spots, smaller garages, etc. 
There would still be a market for them, but definitely MUCH smaller. || He gets shit done and people love that.

And people who work hard often play hard. || Thanks. I'm a bit slow || Why is it the perfect time to buy at $12, and not when it was $10, or $9?

People seem to forget this stock was in the single digit not that long ago. || So did Tesla, until they didn’t || For sure.  

It doesn’t mean that vw is doomed or bad. It could find ways to outperform.   

It (the legacy) is the opportunity that makes it worthwhile to sink billions of dollars to try and compete.  

 The legacy is spending some of the cash that is flowing on stuff that is perhaps slightly obsolete or not as fast or not as efficient, or is interest.   

A new entrant who gets over the massive hump has much more choice with cash.

There is a window of opportunity that opens and closes as these debt loads are new and then grow.  

 It is tied to the innovation in the space in a way.    

 It’s also why a firm like vw would have interest in investing in a firm like rivian. 

From vw’s perspective, rivian is an opportunity to sort of rejuvenate/refresh the debt to a degree, to stay present in innovative cash flows. || Same with gme and even google.  The numbers for google are the best among the faang and it has the lowest pe || He’s “got a good feeling about it”. || You read that right. It’s never about the numbers.  Just look at Tesla or gme || I think it was just 11 months ago Tesla had a big inventory glut and was having to give massive promotions to sell units.  They’ve been slashing margins ever since on a trajectory to get down to what their fellow car makers live with.

At the same time, public perception of the vehicle quality has gone from high to trash, and the brand reputation has been tarnished by their crooked mascot.  Even he is finally sort of admitting his promise of a sub 30k car was a lie.  They may want to play in the low dollar, low margin space, but that’s not going to be as much fun. || Massive breadth of products?  Promises, not products.  Many of which have 2028 promise dates, from a source who has never made a deadline or kept a promise in his life. || This is a hilarious take on TSLA.  || > been performing mostly flat

I guess my English is rusty, didn't know ""flat"" meant up 1400% || A vehicle where you can update the ECU over the air. Whoopee! || I mean it doesn’t take much for Rivian to be modestly successful. It takes a LOT of sales for Tesla to keep growing and justify its insane valuation. || A lot of Tesla purchased people bought due to it is cheap with EV credit that will be end next year. This means whole EV market will be facing difficult time next year including Rivian. It would be continued next 4 years, unfortunately. || You realize that valuations are built on more than 1 or 2 years of sales, right? R2 changes everything in relation to sales. The market is obviously limited on 100k large SUVs. || > That is a lot of imagination.

Is it though?  Compared to building entire lines of beautiful high tech electric vehicles from scratch, it’s not.

If I sold cakes and was constrained by my frosting supplier, I’d be figuring out how to make my own frosting by morning. And in so doing, I’d be making better and cheaper frosting and upping my profits, removing a point of failure, and setting up for better growth.

Considering the miles they’ve already come, this could be like an inch  of a step for Rivian.

> think the biggest hurdle is the market for electric cars. Almost half the people who have bought electric vehicles in North America say their next car will be an ICE vehicle

This is the big myth.  Rivian doesn’t need to sell 350 million vehicles to 350 million Americans.  The stock will explode if they can do 0.1% of that.  

As such, it doesn’t matter if 50% of people hate EVs and 50% of the ones who don’t just hate Rivian and 50% of the rest can’t afford it, etc.  Once you’ve winnowed them all away, there’s still people who will.  Someone out there buys candy corn, and onions.  Nobody know why, but they do.

I personally don’t understand why anyone buys goop or Pepsi or air fryers.  But I know that there’s enough people who do that it’s completely meaningless what my personal preference or really anyone’s individual anecdotal tastes are.  As long as there’s 300 people who want to buy the 100 Ferraris being produced, you’ve got yourself a hot business.  Rivian just needs 51,000 people who want to buy the 50,000 cars they make, rinse and repeat.  

> Add to that, Trump is going to remove the EV tax credit and it is becoming less an issue about production capacity and more about market desire.

Again, the people who are going to care about that don’t matter because they weren’t going to buy a Rivian or they’re replaceable by people who will.  Someone dumping $80k on a depreciating item is not really a stickler for parsimony. 

I see people spending a fortune on known lemons every day.  I don’t know why.  Then they buy the window etching.  They buy emotionally, not on penny pinching, especially with higher dollar purchases.

Pop over to Rivian sub.  There’s electricians who realized that swapping their $1500 gasoline truck cost per month for a $1200 Rivian payment and a $100 charging bill still saves money and makes life nicer, so why should they care about an EV credit going away?

That’s part of the beauty of being small.  Rivian doesn’t have to be the affordable car for every human.  They only need to find 50,000 affluent customers this year, which they have.

> There isn't going to be another player enter the market and be the next tesla because when tesla did it, they had next to no competition.

I heard this about Intel.  And blackberry.  And Cisco.  And Enron.  And Gateway.  And so on.  

Remember, Rivian doesn’t need to replace Tesla and Coca Cola, they just need to find *their* customers at the right intersection of product and price.  

> or some gamechanging technology, which rivian does not.

What’s “gamechanging” about Apple’s 17 version of a phone?  Or “gamechanging” about Celsius Soda or Red Bull Soda or Monster Soda or Pepsi Soda?  They’ve all eaten fine while so has hundred year old Coca Cola.  

It’s not winner take all. || Most of their profit in the early days came from selling carbon credits. It still makes up a big chunk of their revenue. || Guess you don't understand Tesla was around for 20 years 🤣🤣 and aren't old enough to remember all these same arguments of why they would fail. || and they still almost went bankrupt, multiple times. || They didn’t make most of their money from the actual vehicle sales. Govt programs. || Ramping up takes time lmao do you think factories get built overnight || Rivian is at the same stage in business as Tesla was when it released the Model S.  Rivian won two awards last week for the R1 & R3. 

Rivian technology is excellent when it comes to the Software designed vehicle.  So much that Vw is now going to build Porsche, Audi and VW off it.  

It takes time and money to build the brand and production.  I live near Seattle and people that own the R1 are obsessed. The Amazon drivers love the vans. The demand is there, but the volume is low since they are a luxury vehicle. If the R2 has the same attention to detail as the R1 at $45k.  This stock will go parabolic. 

It reminds me of when the Iphone came out. It had a cult like following.  Then it spread.

They have 14 stores in total. They plan to open another 50 this year. || Fractals are fun! || not always, can't go lower then $0 || It’s already down 90%, why it can’t go down another 90%?

Ultimately, unless either company has desirable and affordable cars they will go bankrupt. || Plus VW has invested billions || This is **survivor bias.** || Because they haven't proven that they can lower their costs to the point where they can make money.

Tesla was making way fewer cars while it figured out manufacturing (Model 3).  Rivian is ramping production and is losing money faster.  They need to vertically integrate and otherwise reduce costs, or raise prices. || Because Elon is such a genius. /sarcasm || Tesla came close to bankruptcy several times along the way. They were one of the first meme stocks, and made it because they were able to issue shares *and* have their share price *increase* at the same time. || Its way different doing it the second time.

The rewards are less and the and that effects the investment theory. || Tesla is still incredibly over valued lol || [removed] || Tesla was worth something like 250 million at IPO and they were making and selling cars. Rivian was valued at something like 80 billion at IPO and making nothing at the time? || Tesla by this point had decent margins you realize?

Go walk around SF and you’ll see all the self driving cars are Waymo. Might was well buy Google unless you really think TSLA is going to do anything to ever justify that ridiculous P/E ratio || It was simply food for thought on his last comment. Any DD he wants to do to make his case is completely up to him. I am neither bullish or bearish on the company, just pointing out the flaw in his thinking. || Well this might be good news but not necessarily.

Such “blue collar insider channel checks” are great when they tip you off to some little known surge in production and sales.  

However in the case of rivian, their production is very well known and it’s currently stalled.  They went from 25,000 vehicles produced per year to 57,000 and then this year they forecast... 57,000 again.  For various reasons, like they were production and capital limited.  But worse, two quarters ago they had to dial that back to 50,000 forecast because of a part shortage.  Then a couple weeks ago the reiterated that to 47-50,000 because the part shortage still isn’t resolved.

So whatever this person is seeing, that production is already known and priced in.

Rivian formerly had big plans for a big factory which would provide for huge production growth, but early this year they postponed that because they were way too cash starved to survive and build the new factory.  

They’ve since had serious capital injections and commitments from VW, and a loan from congress to help revive the second factory build project.  That’s all very positive.  

BUT if one is being a critical investor, they have to realize that if VW gets into trouble or their own, they would break their commitments to Rivian, contracts and rules and penalties be damned.  They also have to realize factory builds are notoriously expensive and lengthy.  

And yesterday, there’s reports that the corrupt CEO of a leading EV company is abusing his leverage with the next president to try and sabotage the number 2 pure EV competitor, Rivian.  It might not be fair or legal, but these are risks someone needs to consider.

I trade in and out of rivian.  I’ll buy it any day when it dips to $10 or below, which is often enough.  I’ve learned to take 20 or 30% gains when they happen, since rivian often falls back on the same repetitive bad news.

Up to this year, Rivian’s CEO has been reliable and kept his promises.  I’d like to see him manage growth without entering another cycle of devasting long term losses bogged down in a 10 year factory build or something.

Maybe that means using some existing vacated or contract factory to do sustainable boosts to production.  Worry about getting to 100,000 production before worrying about 1 million.  Worry about improving margins.  That kind of thing.  Act like a startup that has to use every dollar wisely.  Once that shows some results and they’ve proven themselves a bit, then maybe that’s a better time for a big splash investment in a futuristic factory.  

Ideally I hope he figures out this part shortage.  Maybe use VW money to create a micro factory of their own for whatever these parts are, so they can avoid this kind of fiasco and get those critical parts cheaper.  I’d love to see a quarter in which they announce exactly this: that we didn’t just solve the part shortage, we dramatically cost-improved our supply chain... and now that means we can double production for 2025.  That kind of thing would put RIVN to $20 || Sure, but you’re thinking of rivian in terms of whether it’s going to be a 40 million vehicle per year mass market.  It’s not.  They’re at about 50,000 per year (and kind of stalled at that level). They’re essentially a boutique scale car maker.

But that’s not necessarily bad.  The best performing automaker stock in the world is Ferrari, and you don’t see a lot of those on your streets either.  You don’t need to sell millions of units, you just need a nice profit on whatever smaller number you do sell.

Maybe it means focus their very production-limited efforts on cranking out vans for amazon or on custom orders for rappers.  Whatever is most profitable would be best at this time, frankly. || Yea probably, I don't go to the states so I don't know much about the yard signs. Not really a thing we do in Canada || Of course they do. But it’s all dependent on their next model, the R2, which is supposed to come out in 2026. Then the R3 the following year. These are more mass market vehicles in a much more profitable segment.

I don’t think they see $100 for quite some time though. Making cars is just a really tough business, and margins are thin. I really hope the best for them but it’s gonna be a struggle for awhile. || This. They need more profits. I don’t see it at $100/ a  share.

 You think tesla went up because investors are stupid and bought into fsd or something, and tesla stock is powered by unicorn farts.

The truth is, tesla has been gross margin positive on their cars since q1 2013.... more than 11 years... and in 2013 total, tesla only delivered 22000 cars

Rivian is producing more than twice as many cars annualy in 2024 as than tesla did in 2013, and their gross margins are abysmal...

So keep making that comparison to tesla... keep telling yourself numbers have nothing to do with it || [removed] || You seem to be poorly informed and focus only on the vehicle department of Tesla

They also have a huge commercial robotics arm that offer solutions for manufacturing for both automotive and again, battery technology.

But I just can’t see it at the moment with how quickly they are burning through cash. I’m absolutely rooting for their success, I just won’t do it with my portfolio. || Least it’ll never go to zero in that case || Down 90 percent x times = (.1)^x...isn't a fractal || Exactly. Look at the outstanding share count. They are only going to dilute shareholders even more with the VW partnership || Also, Tesla did it back when EV technology was far less mature.

Now that technology advanced, it should be much easier to break even. || 💯 || For a sub that is so dead set on never buying anything that isn’t fundamentally sound, this entire comment was just nonsensical and untrue. Using terms like vertically integrate doesn’t mean your comment has any substance. And I own zero Rivian and have never owned any Rovian  || Vertically integrate what? || This is abject nonsense. Teslas break even point came in 2019 and by that point they had produced nearly 1m cars since 2013. The year they broke even they had ramped up production to 350k cars. The year prior. 250k cars. The year prior 100k. Next 75k. Next 56k.

Rivian are making the same amount of cars that Tesla were when they were 5 years away from break even. 

So if you’re going to try to join in to a conversation about profit and sales figure, at least know the subject matter. Rivian are actually ahead of where Tesla was at the same point. 

And prices don’t matter in the way you think they do. They’re not making poor quality but price accessible entry level EVs like the M3. Everyone I’ve ever met that owns a Rivian (30+) went from expensive cars like MB, BWM, Tesla S or X, etc, and have no problem dropping $60+ on a car. People are dumping the higher end Tesla in droves. || . || You can also argue that people have gotten used to buying evs and want better cars without horrific quality control issues and not aligned with and ill out it politely, toxic CEO/owner. 

If anything it’s easier for these condones because they’re not having to concise people to switch from ICE to EV, they just have to entice them with better products, not a new category of product. || That may be so in your opinion, but exactly half the market thinks otherwise, and thus we have the price we have today. || People were saying that years ago and yet here we are. || Well, no:

- after the S they nearly killed themselves going even more upmarket making the X, and then finally they went for the 3. 

- In 2012 they lost $386M with 2650 cars sold for a loss of about $145,000 per car. || Tesla lost money until 2013, and when their first quarterly profit was announced the stock popped very, very nicely. 

My point is, if you bought TSLA when they were losing money on every car, you are very very happy today, and you were even happy as early as 2013. So IMO it’s a fallacy to use that argument today against Rivian. Unless you think they won’t ever make money, but there were plenty of people even in 2012 that didn’t think Tesla would make it. || Commenter's point still stands though. || I would subscribe to your newsletter.

They renegotiated those contracts and lowered costs by 20-30%.

They were losing $140k per vehicle over year ago. Losing 30k in Q2.  They had noted Q3 would be worst quarter of year early last year. 

RJ stated the VW investment gave them enough capital to launch R2& R3 and build the Georgia Factory.  

Rivian stated they will post gross positive profit in Q4 of 2024. Once that happens it will allow institutional money to get in.  Many funds cant buy companies not turning a profit. Once that happens, buckle up. || I'm reading this while eating pumpkin pi || Except even well established car companies struggle with EVs || Tesla had customers. The EV market has stagnated. || The obvious comparison for Rivian is Tesla.  Tesla succeeded in lowering costs by building more and more of the sub components themselves.  They famously pride themselves on building it themselves if they can - this means not needing to give some of the vehicle profit (for the outsourced components) to a third party.  They are relentless with their engineering and re-engineering to do things cheaper:

* Gigacastings instead of a lot of welding
* building their own electronics and controllers so they can consolidate them
* Moving to 48v from 12v to massively reduce the amount of copper they need in their wiring assemblies
* Building their own battery cells and assembling the battery packs themselves

 OP listed some reasons in the ""for"" column for Rivian.  Unfortunately none of them does anything to make them profitable.  A 35K car is NOT what they should be looking at now - it will not make them any profit based in their current manufacturing methods.  It will accelerate their cash burn.

Look at their Income Statement - their revenues are declining and they are still losing 1+B each Q.

Look at their Balance Sheet - their cash is declining and their liabilities are going up.

So as an investor I ask myself the question.  Do I see a path forward for this company surviving?  Is the company showing me that they have a handle on how to make a profit?  Management needs to show me they can make a profit or at the very least describe their plan to do so.

Rivian only has so much time to do this.  At some point customers will start to shy away from buying if they feel the company is not going to remain a going concern.  Look at Fisker Automotive....

Personally I think Rivian is making a lot of very good decisions that won’t necessarily pay off in the short term this year but are setting themselves up for the long term. No other startup EV is poised for success like Rivian. || Your probably correct , but for years the only profit was credits paid from other automakers || Betting on meme stocks is gambling, not investing.

In terms of Rivian, they \*did\* partner with a big player so we can see how this plays out but as of now, it's not enough to drag them out of the mud. Finally, the only potential you've mentioned so far is people mass-pumping it as a meme and another big player partnering with them for whatever reason. Those reasons are about as hard as possible to predict. || Tesla was priced very cheaply in 2018-2019 when it was unclear if they could reach profitability. Once profitability occurred, the stock skyrocketed.

in 2020-2021 the margins appeared insane, and were for a while but production eventually caught up with demand, and margins dropped, and Tesla's valuation today prices in a good probability that fsd and other future revenue drivers will help tesla massively grow beyond a car maker.

Rivian is priced very cheaply because they're so far away from profitability that the company basically has no value. It feels like they're building tesla roadsters - ie first gen products - but instead of stopping when they realized it was unprofitable, they're burning through billions and are trying to convince investors somehow they'll make it up with more volume... || You will lose all your money in Rivian, mark this post. || Volatile implies it goes up and down….since the ipo it’s pretty much gone down……lol || Is that a fractal? || lol what?

You’d know this if you actually read the financials. 

It’s funny that when Tesla did this sort of thing and production was halted or the German factories that were “cash furnaces” for over a year don’t get talked about in the same way by Tesla fans. I didn’t hear you screaming about them needing to turn it around from 2013 while they burned through $12bn and got the most generous subsidies any car company ever got - it was hype and to the moon etc. Rivian are poised to steal the entire top end of the car market but also people who are getting an EV and can’t sanction Musks buffoonery. || [deleted] || I’d buy in with a consistent up trend.

It’s 2025 and Tesla isn’t the only viable game in town anymore, far from it, they’re now dated (aesthetically) and their newest release has been an unmitigated disaster. I can’t actually think of a recent car launch that has gone worse than the cyber truck."

This is system that took decades to get to T+1.

We already have extended hours which are incredibly low liquidity and basically a Wild West.

Near as I can tell, extended hours trading mostly serves media interests so they can report on real time price reactions to after hours earnings, or on fair value va future opening in the morning.

I like being able to check how my portfolio did for the day a few minutes after the market closes.

So much BS and market manipulation happening outside of market hours. It absolutely murders retail.

Pretty sure majority of stock market movement takes place after hours. || I like the idea.

All the coke in the world isn't going to let Finance bros keep up || Prices already move at night right now, it’s why stocks gap up or down at the open. This is just giving you more opportunities. Instead of waking up the next morning and seeing your stock down 10%, and you couldn’t do anything about it, you could now act on it before it becomes that bad || Seems like a lot of you folks forget that there’s a significant number of people that invest in the US stock market that are outside the US that already have to go to sleep during trading hours. 

It’s not a big deal and works fine for them. I don’t see why it can’t work for Americans too. People are being way overdramatic in this sub. || It would crash and recover while you sleep, so you’d miss on the recovery pump too. || This is such a kneejerk and old-fashioned reaction imo. Markets will evolve accordingly. || That's why we have circuit breakers 

And liquidity is poor anyways in the extended trading hours that are available rn. || yeah,... nuclear war starts ... good thing we can't sell until 930am tomorrow.... that'll change everything for sure 


if things get overblown overnight, great, buy it and it'll rebound, or just wait

I get off work 2 and a half hours before the market opens, and some days I've gotta stay up just to make a single trade. I want sleep, dammit || As someone not from the US, I dont mind this as well. || 100%, on the other side of the world so market hours are in the middle of the night for, this would be a huge improvement. || Exactly. People in here really want to have less trading hours rather than more. Like guys, if you really want fewer hours, why not go down to just 1 hour per day? 

It makes no sense. That is just being a Luddite. || Who will maintain the system? It needs regular maintenance and these updates will be rolled out on the weekends || I think I would fair better in the casino🤣 let it all ride on red... 50/50 same odds. || I guess that’s the point of it all, people like to gamble and most retail traders suck and if the casino never closes the big money can take the little guys money allll day long. || Agree. Almost every time I get a minute from work to buy something, the markets either not open yet or already closed. Would be happy to make trades in the evening after work. || I know...

Once regulatory checks and balances are met, the second stage will see trading operate 23 hours each weekday with a one-hour pause to update software. || I think probably more just for paperwork so they can record official daily start and close prices. 

Once they figure out how to update the ledger for continuous market hours they can make the next step to being open 24/5 and then 24/7. || Big money needs lunch too. || Legitimately made so that hedge firms can have a night crew and screw retail while they sleep. If this isn't anymore obvious and should be illegal then it isn't any better than the Southpark skit, annnnnnnndddd it's gone. || Already can do that. Try Crypto. Nothing like waking up 10k poorer || 🤣 technology that happens now || If something happened in the markets rich people would’ve already cashed out… doesn’t really matter.

Would restrict movement for other places and really put limits on how other countries operate when it comes to the US market. || Legend || No recovery if it's trading 24/7 the world doesn't sleep on your schedule. || [deleted] || Except this will fix the liquidity problem. Other brokers will be forced to follow suit, people will trade. || In that event your money isn't worth crap. Hope you stock piled on canned and dry beans. But a fake news about an attack would receive a knee jerk reaction later to be corrected but in the mean time a mass sale can tank the market. || TY🙏 || Yes, but 24 hour trading doesn't solve the issue lol. Time zones are an inescapable fact of life- all major trading firms/desks are in CST/EST for this reason. No professional trader on the West Coast wants to wake up at like 5 AM. (Not to mention latency sending orders in)

**Rant:** The current US system already sucks- the players who can take advantage of a 24 hour exchange are large institutions with trading desks around the globe and market makers who can tweak algos for less liquidity/rules outside normal trading hours.

As a trader (retail or professional), you want less trading hours in the day to maximize volatility in a shorter timeframe- Hong Kong does it best with no after hours, a one hour lunch break for their traders so everything except for two ETFs are halted, and then a 3 hour trading session afterhours.

No one wants to wake up at like 3 AM in any timezone to trade some surprise news headline and they're not getting good prints doing so. No one but institutions with European and Asian desks can reasonably take advantage of those. This obliterates WLB for those that are actual full-time traders. || Let me keep my advantage thank you very much. || you can't place orders that will execute on market open?  || Let me tell you about this revolutionary idea called a shift system. || Who maintains your banking system that you can pay bill , withdraw money. They don’t need regular maintenance? || 2026 it will be 37/11 || well, while I can see how this could possibly be a disadvantage for independent swing traders, in theory I don’t think it should make a difference for people who are engaged in long-term investing, would be my first thought || I wonder how this would affect Pattern Day Trading rules || It's better than getting your stop loss gapped || Not really. Aftermarket trades are more or less like you and me making an agreement afterhours at some set price. And then we publish the price we agreed upon. It does not represent true markets or trade. 

When the markets open, it will immediately move to a position that the market as a whole agrees on. What a few trades after hours has no real bearing on anything nor the volume. || Make them conform to the US market timing then.... I mean most people overseas do stay up late to trade in the US market anyway. The intra-market period is the best time to trade after all || American moment. || Why shouldn't there be a recovery? Only down from now on? || I hard disagree with your take. You really think fewer market hours is better than more? And you think Hong Kong is the market to emulate. No. || You can already trade 19 hours a day || a mass sale tanking the market, temporarily, only to a point where the fail safe auto closes the market .... sounds like a great buying opportunity 

and then, once it auto shuts, people realize Armageddon didn't actually happen, prices return to normal



almost... like ... if you didn't ... check prices.... nothing changes...... 

how is the futures market open nearly 24/7 and the sky hasn't fallen yet? || Yeah, this will just give algorithmic trading even more control of the market || For stocks, yes, but i trade a lot of options.  || They do need regular maintenance... our Apps runs on the VAST data platform, which allows us to maintain the back end without Outage. || Yes, that will be the new official workday per the DOGE. || 2027 it will be 7/11 || Exactly, r/Bogleheads will be like “meh, just another day”. || Isn't this actually advantageous for options traders? Given that options can only be traded during market hours || It would hurt the US market in my opinion. Traders in japan for example would need to stay up till 2am to trade US equities.

I don't think a 24/7 open market would be a good idea but having an after market as such is probably the best medium. || [deleted] || Robinhood is just trading derivatives no real stock is purchased || Not on fidelity || Not really. Ymmv. Depending on your broker, you're not actually trading. You just locking in a price, they're the ones trading, and they may or may not decide to fulfill your price the next business day || Or a computer sell off from being hacked to continue to tank the market. The prices of futures contracts are determined by fair value calculations, which ensure that the market reflects the expected future value of the underlying asset. This limits swings in prices. Stocks do not. || I think so. I keep profit stops and stop losses on and if they can hit at night, that's just better for me. I hate seeing back and forth in after hours and then the market opens and I could have won overnight but now we are back to the prior days price. I expect this will be great. || Yes to the fact that you don’t have to worry about getting wrecked during after market hours. || So what? Traders in Hawaii need to wake up at 4:30 am to start a full trading day. Screw Japanese or any other investors if they aren't interested in dealing with omg *time zones*. Besides, limit trades exist? || My take is just the opposite of your take. Freer markets are better. More hours are freer. I want to be able to trade 24/7. This idea you have that retail traders are going to be run over by institutions and should play in controlled kiddie hours is weak shit. || I had no idea about that, I use ibkr and I can't find anything about it being derivatives. || again, would trip the system stops 

and again, an overnight event where futures are open but stocks are not, futures can and do react to news and is often used as leading indicator of what value the underlying asset should have in the future 

there is no arbitrator of value that decides how much the futures market can rise or fall in response to particular after hours earnings sessions or a fed announcement 

ie: the market dictates the price

however, sky has yet to fall || Actively discouraging people and making it more difficult for them to use a service does not tend to be effective when trying to incentivise or encourage more customers. || The US market is a global market whether you like it or not. This seems to make you mad for some reason. || [deleted] || So let's say some market manipulator writes on his social media the sky is falling. Folks start dumping then AI or computer set sell level starts dumping. This leads to liquidation how wait brokerages don't have the funds they can't transfer funds to your account or bank and you have a bank run. || What you’re describing is an outdated system. It’s really that simple. || sure, it's called a panic sell and it's been a thing long before computers and can and has happened during business hours as well

that's why they have automatic stops now, if the market moves a certain amount in a certain time period, they automatically close the market no matter what time or day || Fair Value Calculation: The prices of futures contracts are determined by fair value calculations, which ensure that the market reflects the expected future value of the underlying asset. This process helps maintain equilibrium and prevents extreme price movements.

Arbitrage: Market participants, including arbitrageurs, continuously monitor and adjust their positions to exploit price discrepancies between the futures market and the underlying asset’s spot market. This process helps eliminate price inefficiencies and prevents violent price movements.

Risk Management: Futures traders, particularly institutional players, employ robust risk management strategies, including position sizing, stop-loss orders, and diversification. These measures help mitigate potential losses and prevent excessive leverage, which can contribute to violent market movements.

Market Liquidity: The futures market is characterized by high liquidity, with many participants and a wide range of contract sizes available. This liquidity helps absorb and distribute market orders, reducing the likelihood of violent price movements.

Regulatory Oversight: Regulatory bodies, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), monitor and enforce market integrity, ensuring that market participants adhere to risk management guidelines and do not engage in manipulative or disruptive trading practices.

Market Psychology: Futures traders, including retail investors, are generally aware of the risks involved and tend to be cautious in their trading decisions. This prudent approach helps prevent excessive speculation and reduces the likelihood of violent market movements.

Diversification: The futures market is diversified across various asset classes, including commodities, indices, and currencies. This diversification helps reduce the impact of any single market or sector on the overall market, preventing violent price movements.

Not the stock market. || [deleted] || lol are you chat gpt? because you posted a bunch of definitions that are unrelated 

fair market value, is just an arbitrary definition. No one can accurately define what the fair market value of Microsoft saying they did something, like abandon all AI investment, the futures market (everybody as a whole) decides that price by buying and selling || It’s a completely meaningless question. Are you just going to ad hom me? What does “full-time” mean when the market is not open “full-time”? Having a Wall Street job? That is outdated thinking.

Actually we should look at the crypto markets for inspiration. I’m not a big crypto investor but having 24/7 trading is a HUGE feature.

One of the research papers he cites attributes it in part due to most Democrat presidencies starting when risk aversion is high (e.g., right after a recession begins) vs. GOP presidencies starting when risk aversion is low. One hypothesis being that high risk aversion (say from recession) = voters want more social insurance = elect Democrats, but being highly averse to risk also means demand for equities is relatively lower, depressing valuations. Thus, future returns are going to be higher.

Conversely, if risk aversion is low (economy is booming), voters prefer business friendly candidates and simultaneously will have bid up equities, reducing future expected returns.

I find it amusing that just as we are about to have a Republican president again, the economy is booming, S&P 500/Nasdaq are frothy, risk aversion is very low, meme stocks getting bid up, all pointing toward lower expected returns. Somehow the historical pattern will probably repeat the next 4 years.

Caveat--the first Trump presidency broke this trend, and sample sizes are low so unclear how robust this pattern is.  Also, for what it is worth, I attribute little to how much specific policies of a President actually impacts market returns. This is more about how investors perceive administrations as well as coincidental timings of the business cycle (which impact how people vote). Moreover, this historical pattern goes back a century, and both parties have seen enormous changes in policy stances, so hard to make a broad point about who is actually better for markets. || Don't hate,  appreciate || Good morning everyone

Anyone here still holding ASTS? I believe in the company and I made profit earlier during summer but i ""relapsed"" and bought back before earnings...so now I either wait and average down or just cut my losses and move on || It's really scary when you think about the way that trading algos work with market makers. You have people like Trump announcing tariffs, only for the next day they get the mexican president to say ""no no no Trump will be nice"" , and the market just pumps higher and higher off of gimmicks like that. When stocks stall, they create an illusionary ""obstacle"" only to tell you the next day it doesn't exist this causes the algos to go crazy and have an orgasm.

Make America Great Again! All thanks to President Trump || I'm trying to find the data, but I believe that if you remove George W Bush (who took office at essentially the height of the dot com boom and left 2 months before the GFC bottom) from the record, the market performance is much more even between Dems and Reps. Bush was [-40%](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/business/stock-market-by-president/index.html) over his term and the only recent president not to see a gain over their administration.

Going all the way back to 1927 adds in Herbert Hoover who watched a nearly 90% decline happen until the bottom in 1932. That really hurts the average. His overall performance isn't quite as bad (-82%), still by far the worst in the sample. I believe [Nixon](https://www.macrotrends.net/2481/stock-market-performance-by-president#google_vignette) is the only other president to have negative returns overall and much of that was right at the end of his term. 

On the other hand, Clinton is the high achiever of the last century. He saw over 200%, even ahead of FDR despite 4 fewer years. However, big asterisk for leaving before the worst of the dot com crash. || Again not a political comment, this election was interesting in the sense that the perception of the economy was bad and that issue had the highest weightage among voters, however the stock market is booming and risk aversion as you said is low. There is a dichotomy.

I don’t believe your statement that people voted republican because risk aversion is low, to me it seems like the average American FELT that their finances went worse this current term and wanted a drastic change. || ""sample sizes are low""

Make a decision and try to learn from it, whether you go long, short or decide to abstain from the market, try and learn from it and don’t get fixated on what you think the market “should” do, like some seem obsessed with.

I’m not saying it couldn’t keep flying and you couldn’t keep crushing (on paper) but I’d personally be uncomfortable where you’re at, and will be happy if/when some of my shares get called away covered by Dec 20 22.5 calls and _definitely_ if another tranche of shares covered by Jan 50 calls ends up ITM. || It's neither here nor there || Is it too late ? || Collars || Cringe || And what taxes will pay for gran grans medicare health insurance? || Looking at both a 2003 and 2022 paper, it seems the gap in returns is still robust to outliers, statistically significant, valid in smaller sub-samples, and also huge in value. I actually think it is not just driven by a few freak outliers, surprisingly. The 2022 paper even shows the gap applies to international markets too.

Also it is not as simple as 'what did the S&P return', it's the estimate of the risk premium over treasuries. And these papers do a whole bunch of other technical modifications I'm probably ignoring for simplicity. They add controls for a bunch of things (i.e., they did a fancy regression).

You can have a voter base that is very unhappy that groceries/cost of living is higher but also in the aggregate have investors inclined to dump money into financial assets. || If you're talking like yield curve inversions, or entire Presidencies, for sure. If you're working with highly granular data, like say across many thousands of financial assets and their values on a day by day (or even hour by hour) basis, then sample sizes (and dimensions, in a statistical sense) are pretty high. Problem is with financial data the amount of noise/confounding/underlying trend makes even high sample sizes not very useful. 

For example, if you're trying to assess the typical reaction of the stock market to the news release of a jobs report, we have a pretty good sample size. || No, there are sample sizes that can produce statistically very meaningful results and small sample sizes where you can’t realistically claim a trend is real and not due to chance, and everything in between. Saying a sample is small or large is talking in the sense of potential statistical meaning, and they can very much be too small, and can also be large. || This isn't trading advice, just a weird historical pattern!

Look at that chart. || i wasn't paying attention.... was quantum bullshit hyped 3 years ago too? || for you it is. For me its not. I already have half of my net worth in it at $28. SO I can afford to average up significantly more and still be ahead of the game. || This was also the case during the latter half of the Roaring '20s. || I just meant in the silly philosophical sense of, well if we wait 1000 years these sample sizes are tiny, or if we wait however long. Into infinity. What seems like a big sample size to us is really only relative to our lifetime, and as investments pass on generations even what we feel are the large samples now could be meaningless to those later gens because of how small they are || Considering the massive inflation in the past 4-5 years its no wonder. Adjust all those gains for inflation and it seems more reasonable. The only suckers are the people that hoard cash and never invest. They pay you some good returns. || They borrow money to buy bitcoin. || Lie to investors.

When I first read about trend following / managed future / general momentum strategies it sure sounded like some TA nonsense pushed by Twitter furus, but I see my favorite fundamental oriented hedge fund investors like Cliff Asness at AQR making trend following a core strategy.

It's the IQ bell curve meme all over: ""Buy stocks that go up a lot"" --> ""Look at fundamentals"" --> ""Buy stocks that go up a lot""

Using it for a single, pre-revenue stock at 50% of your port.... yeah, not so bright. But I sure hope it works for that person. || Brother, not even god can stop this stock. Thats how confident I am. $50 end of year target. AT LEAST || [removed] || I haven’t looked into it too deeply but I think I have noticed a trend where there are certain mid cap stocks that have gone up in a more or less steadily line for several years that seem to be favoured by hedge funds. Maybe that’s partly because they see continued steady growth in those companies, and partly because the trend itself is seen as reliable. But the sort of crazy rally we’ve seen with IONQ, with a valuation mostly driven by hype and wild optimism rather than any real fundamentals, and that has been pretty short lived so far, I’m not sure we can have much confidence in the strength of that trend. I’d be very surprised if hedge funds did either but maybe you know something I don’t. || [removed] || [removed] || [removed] || [removed]"
Thoughts on buying BRB.K this month instead of DCAing into S&P?,"Does anyone have any thoughts on buying BRB.K this month as a one off instead of the usual DCA into S&P 500?

I usually allocate the same amount of money to S&P 500 every month and have done this for years. However given much the stock market is up (27% YTD), especially including the recent trump mania, I think we are due a pull back.

And the way Buffet has been selling stocks recently, so does he. However would spending the same amount this month on Berkshire Hathaway stock instead of S&P, as a one off, hedge against this risk. 

WB has the highest stock pile he’s ever had, whilst still in the market albeit much smaller. I was just thinking it as a way of further diversification - I’ll obviously keep all of my investments in the S&P but as a one off for this month was thinking it could be wise to load up on BH stock, so can receive the benefits of the business of interest from their cash holdings as well as their equity holdings. 

Do you guys think this is a reasonable thought process or just stick to the plan and keep DCAing into the S&P this month?

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/stocks) if you have any questions or concerns.* || Just wanted to point something out if you're going base your thesis on percentage of annual return:

BRK.B's average annual return (not dividend adjusted) for the past 15 years is \~17%.

SPY's average annual return (again, not adjusted for dividends) for the past 15 years is \~15%.

BRK.B is up 36% YTD, which is 211% it's average annual return.

SPY is up 27% YTD, which is 180% it's average annual return.

If this is what you're going to base things on - you think BRK.B would be safer than the S&P if a pullback occurs?

A lot of people may not be aware of this, but 80% of the stocks on the US stock market (BRK.B very much included) move with the S&P500. If the S&P500 takes a shit, BRK.B will take a shit too. Maybe less, maybe more. Everything takes a shit when the market takes a shit, some just more (or less so) than others.

You can see how correlated BRK.B is with the market by looking at it's **beta** \- which currently (according to FinViz) is 0.87. A beta of 1 would indicate the stock moves 1:1 with the overall market, and most household names like BRK.B, MSFT, etc. hover around 1 +/- some small amount.

If your goal is that you want to *hedge* against some sort of S&P500 pullback, BRK.B probably isn't the instrument to use to do it because it's too correlated with the grander market price action.

If you like BRK.B as an investment and you'd like to temporarily pause your S&P additions to put a little into BRK.B, go for it. It's a great stock.

Just don't expect it to save your ass if the pullback that you fear happens. || Even buffett not touching brk at these prices || Berkshire didn't buy back any of their stock for Q3, indicating that they feel their stock is overvalued.

Also from a growth standpoint. The more you look into it the better brk seems right now from a historical hedge against a recession, but also likely outperform anyway viewpoint. || Rsp is a better hedge, look how it performed during covid VS voo || Diversification into BRK.B is a positive move, not because the SPY has gained 27% YTD and you think it might pullback, but because BRK.B has gained 36% YTD.

ps: Imagine what all the cash Buffet is holding can achieve if the market pulls back. || What is BRB-K? || If the pull back happens next week both will go down brk is a trillion market cap company… with a beta nearing one… if a recession happens due to black swan event that doesn’t get government bailout due to high debt loads…. BRK will buy up those assets…. He has buy prices for a lot of companies…. As long as it’s profitable with a side of enduring… his high cash pile will help against short and liquidity contraction….

if u look at their latest purchases, they made huge mistake (buy and only to sell it after few days) one after another

nearly all their investments that were purchased in recent time are under water or was flipped less than 1yr

look at their tsm trade (they bought and sold after few months missing all the huge gains), same with ulta (bought and sold only after few weeks/months).

what are they doing?

same goes for oxy as well. they bought oxy multiple times at the high and stopped buying when price dipped

they've been making too many 'mistakes'

imo, whatever they are doing lately doesn't give any confidence that their competitive edge will be lasting

that's the exact beauty of index etf.

index etf never loses its competitive edge because whatever old company that is falling out of its competition is replaced by new and better one

no single company can have competitive edge that last forever

I'm actually surprised brk stock price is hitting all time high seeing all the blunder moves they are making lately || BRK is my cash position.  When I don't feel like buying markets I'll buy BRK.  Because if markets crater, BRK will probably go up due to their cash position.  If markets go up, it will chug along.  

I suspect at some point it goes straight up in a line, then we must consider the state of the markets. || I’m increasing my cash and small cap positions right now. I’ve liquidated the QQQ in my taxable brokerage.

But if you're looking for things less correlated to market returns, my thoughts immediately turn to utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples.  Say, Waste Management, United Health, and Wal Mart.  Alternatively, XLU, XLP, XLV I think? for an ETF of those sectors. || It could work, you could also buy international markets like VEA which are still very cheap at the moment || Just keep in mind that the cash pile is currently tired up in treasuries for a fixed term, so it's unlikely he WB will be able to pile into stocks if we do see a pull back. || After reading this sub, I’m of the opinion that I will go 50/50 RSP and BRK.B on Monday. || Warren is the face of the company, and his days are numbered. I don't think it's extreme to compare him to Elon at Tesla. When Warren goes, a lot of faith in the Berkshire brand goes away.

If you’re interested in dividend paying value stock, you could also consider this dividend aristocrat ETF called NOBL. I’d also allocate to a bit of commodities as well. || Just no || No || BRK has ~$400b in cash and is well positioned to take advantage of a market pullback. Also a lot of its business is insurance, railroads, etc which tend to be more resilient during bad times. || While I agree with your math, BRK has always been viewed as a conservative, value investment. It’s a place people are likely to put money in a downturn because the companies owned by BRK tend to be more resilient in a downturn. Plus BRK has a good amount of cash sitting around, so they are likely to grab a couple companies in a downturn.    

Obviously anything can happen, but people’s perception of BRK being a safe investment (I believe) makes it likely do go down much less if shit hits the fan- which makes it a good hedge in a downturn  || Brk will typically pull back less during bear markets but not go up as much during bull markets. Past few years have been an exception but Warren never gets hit as hard as the index when it crashes. Especially when tech leads the charge, see 2022 and 2000 tech pullbacks. Got hit during 08 because financials got crushed || I agree with everything you have said, however typically brk has been mostly stock and it's internal companies. Right now it seems poised for a market downturn and i think the stock would do much better than the s&p even if the investment arm is a smaller portion of the company.

I think if there was a big market downturn, brk would buy a few companies. || Can you (or anyone) suggest some good conservative options that have a lower beta? I feel like we're going to get a pullback/correction very soon, but I don't really know what to do with that feeling. (Yeah I get not timing the market, but I still want to.) || This was the chain of reasoning that finally got me to dump my conservative mutual fund for a broad index ETF. Best choice I ever made! || That and buffet is near the end of the road. It's going to get hammered when he dies, even if him leaving is meaningless || And what is that? That if berkshire isn’t buying berkshire stock, no one else should either? The difference is that for us it’s an investment, for them it’s a way to reward shareholders. || OP has been posting the same exact question in like 7 different subreddits || As morbid as it may be this is honestly what I will be timing my buy around || BRK-B in dyslexia || nope, it will crater in a market crash also....just not as much || > Because if markets crater, BRK will probably go up due to their cash position.

When the S&P went down in 2022, BRK followed right along side of it.  I don't think it's cash position will save you through a crash but I'm sure it's better than being in growth stocks. || What are some examples of cash and small cap stocks? || Priced in. || That’s what I’ve done this month. Orders filling on Monday || He's 94 years old. I don't see anyone buying that's concerned about his death. Maybe it drops 1-2% but I can't see it being that significant. Munger's death didn't affect the stock much and he was just as influental as Buffett is. || > I could see a 10-15% drop on the news.

I could see it drop at first.

And then I could see all that cash in the hands of someone who realizes technology is by far the greatest driver of wealth in the 21st century making Berkshire a better company (with a higher share price) than it is today. || During the 2020 flash crash they still got crushed unfortunately despite having large cash reserves. || PEP, tobacco  || His departure is baked in.

Personally I think once he’s gone they’re going to change things up, ie. dividends on brk.b and some other stuff Warren would never do. || They don't see the value in buying it, so other people would probably find a better return investing in another sector/ticker/asset class. They don't want to blindly buyback shares to reward shareholders if they know they can use their cash for better opportunities which would ultimately help their shareholders more in the long run. || It’s possible, but with that much cash, a crash would allow them to steal companies. || When the market crashed in 2008, Apple had 50 cents of cash for every dollar of market value. In a crash, those kinds of fundamentals go out the window. || Berkshire was up 2-3% in 2022 || I’m going to be opening a sizeable position with BRK.B as well, I might just wait for a slightly better price point || BRK isn't making investment decisions in the short window of a flash crash. || (I know this is the stock subreddit, not investing but..) I was thinking of going with a consumer staples ETF like VDC (which includes pepsi, coke, walmart, costco, etc). Maybe it has the spirit of what you're suggesting without putting all my eggs in one basket. || 1.6x book that has a lot of cash?

My guess is that he has lots of cash ready to buy back after he kicks the buffet and stock falls.

I just don't get the valuation || brk isn't what it used to be

  
2020 and 2022 were excellent opportunities and they did nothing || Yet they did nothing in 2020 || I stand corrected.  I just looked at their 5 year chart quickly and didn't dig in. || I’m talking about their share price || The valuation is based on trust. It’s a company with a great history. People trust that. || They were buying AAPL at $145 in 2022 || That dip was too quick least 2020.  I’m talking a black swan like 2008/1929 where we don’t bounce back in a few weeks || Neither of those were BRK buying opportunities. They’re waiting for a black swan event, not a normal market correction. Especially ones as minor (yes, those were minor) as 2020 and 2022. || Maybe they will buy SirusXM lol"
Fellow Canadians: What’s the Difference Between ZSP and VFV?,"I’ve been looking into Canadian ETFs and came across ZSP (BMO S&P 500 Index ETF) and VFV (Vanguard S&P 500 Index ETF). Both track the S&P 500, which is appealing to me because I want exposure to the U.S. market, but I’m trying to understand the differences between these two funds in more depth.

On the surface, they look very similar: both are Canadian-domiciled ETFs that hold U.S. equities and are traded on the TSX. They both offer exposure to the same underlying index, so their holdings should be nearly identical. However, I noticed a few potential areas where they might differ:

**MER (Management Expense Ratio)**: ZSP and VFV have slightly different MERs. Does the lower MER really make a noticeable difference over the long term, or is it more of a ""nice to have""?

**Tracking Error**: Are there any known differences in how closely these funds track the S&P 500? Are there any instances where one deviated more significantly than the other?

**Liquidity and Trading Spreads**: For someone who might not be buying or selling huge quantities, are there noticeable differences in the bid-ask spreads? Do they trade with similar liquidity, or does one tend to have an advantage?

**Currency Hedging**: From what I understand, neither of these funds is hedged to CAD. Is there any other nuance to their handling of currency that I should be aware of?

**Dividend Treatment**: Both distribute dividends, but does one reinvest them differently or handle U.S. withholding tax in a way that might make it more or less tax-efficient?

**Historical Performance**: Have you noticed any meaningful differences in performance between these two over the years? Even if minor, what could explain the difference if the index they track is identical?

Lastly, I’d love to hear what you personally use and why. Are there specific scenarios where ZSP might be better than VFV or vice versa? Is it purely a matter of brand loyalty (Vanguard vs. BMO), or are there more practical considerations?

I'm also curious about how either fits into a broader portfolio. If you’re holding one of these, are you pairing it with other U.S. exposure like QQQ, or do you lean heavily on Canadian equities like VCN for balance?

Any insights, opinions, or anecdotes would be super helpful!

Ocean Exploration Stocks! The next big sector! ,"In my opinion, ocean exploration stocks are heavily overlooked. With only about 5% of the ocean explored, there are so many unknowns and promising possibilities. 

Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and underwater drones is an emerging technology that I have been keeping a close eye on. This technology will make things like resource exploration, climate change research, scientific research, technological advancements and marine conservation more feasible. The are key factors that will drive growth in this sector the next 5-10 years. 

Currently there are a lot of ocean exploration companies that already have solid revenue streams from oil and gas industries and underwater infrastructure like pipelines and umbilicals. I think these current revenue streams will continue to thrive. And future revenue streams are right around the corner. 

Costs of exploration have been the biggest hurdle in this sector, but as technology continues to advance, costs have been quickly dwindling, making more and more projects feasible. 

Companies that I have recently been researching are: OII and TDY. Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts on these companies, and am excited to hear about other companies you find promising in this sector.

I think a lot of their funding devoted to climate research and resilience will be cut and not diverted elsewhere. I think FEMA is a real possibility for privatization, but I wouldn’t even have a guess as to which companies would be given those contracts. It’s way too early to tell at this point. 

The only company Ive heard of doing deep sea mining exploration is The Metals Company from Canada. It’ll likely be years before we see any large scale deep sea mining operations. There’s a lot of push back from environmental groups and uncertainty with international regulation. So any investment into this sector would be highly speculative and risky. || It depends what you believe will happen.  The company is based in the Canadian maritimes and just on the other side of the border Anduril is opening a plant in 1025 for their three ton underwater auv.  The plant is supposed to pump up 200 hulls and have a dive depth of up to 6000m.  The kraken robotics subsea battery depth can operate at depths up to 6000m.  If Anduril starts placing huge battery orders than the stock could soar.

Technology and its effect on stock market average returns. Does the future hold higher average returns?,"I know, I know.......I know. NO ONE knows what the market will do other than it will go up, down or sideways.

But I feel like we live in a different world now than we did the past numerous decades. Everyone has access to investing. Right in the palm of their hands. Virtually anyone anywhere can invest in any market they wish from their phone. Historical returns are 7 percent (inflation adjusted) based on old technology, processes, access and education on finance. It is no longer the days of old where tie wearing NYSE brokers answer their rotary phones screaming about deals and brokering deals for end user. It was a whole process and really, you NEEDED someone to strike the deals for you and in most cases, suggest what funds to invest in since there was no internet to self educate or even research companies to invest in.

Nowadays with giants like Fidelity, Vanguard and others offering index funds that take all of the thought and most of the choice and a lot of the risk out of the equation. I don't need to ask a broker which SP500 fund to buy. I don't need a broker to strike deals for me. I don't even need to make a call or have a person do ANYTHING for me.

I am not a crypto investor, I am a naysayer in fact. But I cannot deny the effect that crypto has had on investing. It has done a LOT to make investing mainstream, if not even trendy. There were always hedge funds and major investors but now regular consumers are taking part and making retail a MUCH bigger player. Retail tripled almost instantly in 2020 and participation has remained high.

Almost all of the hurdles have been removed between the investor and the investment with technology. There is little to understand/learn and is done anywhere, any time for convenience. Not a fan of robinhood but apps like this have put the keys to investing directly into the end users hands.

Now that investing is automatically diversified, exceptionally well returning index funds are in the palm of everyone's hand, consider that the US stock market is the economic powerhouse of the world. Anyone anywhere for the most part can invest in US stock market. This is appealing to anyone in a lesser financial climate (Japan). Now that the wealth gluttons have their claws in every last corner of US government, I don't see them doing anything but moves to further bolster financial and economic markets. The US stock market is the harvesting field of the elite wealth gluttons.

My personal thoughts though as I said, I am aware NO ONE can predict the stock market. But it feels poised to redefine ""average returns"" and with the near future political climate.....if it doesn't get completely blown up (unlikely) I think future returns will far exceed 7 percent as long as the USA remains the economic powerhouse that it is",DawgCheck421,2024-11-29 22:05:52,23,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h2ppqn/technology_and_its_effect_on_stock_market_average/,None,"I’m just going to put right here that it’s going to be unclear if the world has really changed involving stocks until we get past 2030 probably.

The reason why returns are not that high is because there are numerous secular bear markets over the years that have below average returns. The last one was 2000-2009 (or maybe even up to 2013 depending on how you judge). 

It’s just not going to be clear that those have gone by the way of the dodo for another number of years. || Aerotyne || Your argument doesn't match the historical record.

The role of financial institutions in controlling the volume and direction of money flow in the market only began in the late 1950's. ""Retail"", aka individual investors, were the driving force behind the stock market prior to that. Yet valuation multiples along P/E, P/S, P/FCF, etc. as well as market returns were not elevated during this previous period either. || If GDP grows at 3% YoY, can the SP500 maintain 13% YoY? || Retail investors still don’t have that significant of an impact on stocks, most money is moved through billion dollar fund algorithms not me or you trading on robinhood. Also, retail investing is fine now when unemployment is down and the economy is somewhat okay, in a recession I would expect more downward volatility as consumers are more easily manipulated - you could maybe argue that there would be higher highs but then there would also be lower lows. || tech valuations have grown much faster than their earnings growth, so no, it is unlikely to return what it has returned historically.


For example Apple was trading at like 12x earnings a decade ago... tech stocks went from being very cheap to very expensive || This is feelings post devoid of facts or statistics. In other words a shit post. || The present has higher valuations but lower returns (particularly in US markets)

The future will revert to historical returns. It's not ""different this time"".

From the existing (at the time) retail participants. I get what you are saying that but that is kind of my point. I don't feel that the ""historical record"" applies in the advent of new technology which has greatly increased participation and ease. It isn't necessarily WHO is investing, but rather that a lot more dollars are entering the market. Which drives up returns. At no point in history has investing in the stock market been a complete DIY, hassle free experience that requires little to no knowledge and accessible from anyone anywhere in the world. Now ya can

I feel pre 2020 to current is a different investing world. Edit: Downvotes for having a discussion and learning experiences and viewpoints, the reddit way. || Valuations mean nothing when people run imaginary currencies up to 100k a share. || > The future will revert to historical returns

since you're able to tell the future, mind telling me the lottery numbers for next week? || Yeah people are blind to see that investing has changed. It's been on a hyper drive since post covid. || > I don't feel that the ""historical record"" applies in the advent of new technology which has greatly increased participation and ease.

The history of economic development is nothing more than the continual introduction of new technological cycles. This includes services that increase the ease of retail participation. So why should we expect higher-than-average returns indefinitely when your primary justification is something that has been occurring for literally hundreds of years? Innovations and permissive legal changes helped fuel the Mississippi bubble, the Wyoming cattle boom, the Roaring 20's, etc. The latter two had intense speculative inflows from international investors as well.

As I said, the crux of why your thesis is based on assumptions. You're relying on stereotypes of the stock market and vague optimism instead of actual data.  

> It isn't necessarily WHO is investing, but rather that a lot more dollars are entering the market. Which drives up returns.

If the core of your operating thesis was true, we would see a constant acceleration in CAGR over the lifespan of the stock market. Pull up any chart and you'll see this isn't the case. Note that the introduction of seminal new technologies like the personal computer have neither boosted productivity or GDP in the way enthusiasts originally envisioned either.

Over time, stock market returns are mathematically bounded. Ease of participation doesn't exert meaningful long-term upside pressure.

> At no point in history has investing in the stock market been a complete DIY, hassle free experience that requires little to no knowledge and accessible from anyone anywhere in the world.

We can expect worse crashes as well if this holds true. || No doubt, my entire post is speculation and hopium. As charged, I pull no punches about that.

Never, ever has the entire planet had direct access to any investment they want and the ability to research to the worlds end. That is my entire point.

You are clearly more educated in the history of the stock market than I and yes, historical data is all we have to go on sometimes. I will definitely be researching some of the events and timelines you mentioned. Fascinating stuff. I am personally hoping for bigger returns moving forward so my ""not enough"" fun becomes enough to retire.

RemindMe! 20 years || > Never, ever has the entire planet had direct access to any investment they want and the ability to research to the world's end. That is my entire point.

Remember, they said the internet would usher in a transformative era of self-education and knowledge too. The flip side is there's a lot of bad data and incentive to get retail invested regardless of market conditions. 

> I will definitely be researching some of the events and timelines you mentioned. Fascinating stuff. I am personally hoping for bigger returns moving forward so my ""not enough"" fun becomes enough to retire.

Over time the aggregate stock market will go up, and there's always a bull market in some subsector. But understanding which part of the market cycle you're in is essential to preserving hard-won principal."
Reddit overtakes X in popularity of social media platforms in UK $RDDT,"[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/reddit-overtakes-x-in-popularity-of-social-media-platforms-in-uk](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/reddit-overtakes-x-in-popularity-of-social-media-platforms-in-uk)

Reddit, the American online discussion platform, has overtaken X to become the fifth most popular social media platform in the UK, according to the communications watchdog.

Ofcom said Reddit, where users post on discussion threads within topic-based communities, was visited by 22.9 million UK adults in May this year, compared with 22.1 million on X.

The figures make Reddit the fastest-growing large social media platform in the UK and represent a growth of 47% on the same period in 2023. The leap took Reddit above LinkedIn and X into fifth place on the table of UK social media platforms, which is now topped by YouTube after it overtook [Facebook](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook), reaching more than 44 million adults.

Reddit, renowned for its devoted user base who refer to one another as Redditors, appears to have been boosted by updates to Google’s search engine this year.

Farhad Divecha, the managing director of the UK-based digital marketing agency AccuraCast, said: “Google’s latest algorithm update in the first half of 2024 gave Reddit a big boost in organic search traffic. I think that has probably contributed a lot.”

Ofcom also speculated that the change may have been caused [by alterations to how third-party apps accessed its content](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/14/reddit-moderators-vow-to-continue-blackout-in-api-access-fees-row), forcing users of those apps to switch to the Reddit site. The watchdog also flagged publicity around Reddit’s stock market flotation in March this year.

The popularity of X also fell over the same period, according to Ofcom, with its reach falling by 8% since May last year. X has been criticised over content moderation standards since its [takeover by Elon Musk in 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/28/elon-musk-twitter-hate-speech-concerns-stock-exchange-deal) but it has also faced competition since July 2023 from Threads, a rival to X [launched by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/06/meta-launches-twitter-rival-threads-in-100-countries).

The Ofcom figures featured in the watchdog’s annual report into the nation’s digital habits, which revealed that four out of 10 UK adults say they have encountered misinformation or deepfakes, with the majority of those cases occurring online.

The misinformation survey, based on a poll of more than 4,000 UK adults, also found that three in 10 adults believe there is a single group of people who control the world together, with the same number believing there is “significant evidence” of electoral fraud in the UK.

The regulator also found that one-third of UK adults are not confident in judging whether an image or a piece of audio or video has been created by artificial intelligence.",caollero,2024-11-28 19:55:22,1057,166,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h1x2aj/reddit_overtakes_x_in_popularity_of_social_media/,$RDDT,"Enjoying Reddit less the more popular it gets || I'm curious how they define popularity of any of these sites, especially when it comes to determining whether to include bots. || 26b for the 6th most visited website seems low || The funniest thing about reddit is that people love to spend their time complaining on reddit about how reddit sucks.

Elon Musk has only managed to ruin r/elonmusk (rather than the whole site). I found that I'd been banned before ever visiting the subreddit because I questioned Tesla's corporate governance on wallstreetbets. Musk fanboys patrol the whole of reddit looking for anyone who can threaten their cult. || Reddit is entirely dictated by its users. X is dictated by its owner.

The entire system of social media downvoting/upvoting/likes needs to be eliminated and replaced with some other ranking system that brings people together and ensures that good ideas have a chance to be seen and pushed forward by a broader public.

It would be hard to delineate any further, but that only helps RDDT regardless. The market just wants numbers. || They polled a bunch of adults in the UK.  So likely just asked them a series of questions and compared to the previous year. || by mdau || I think most of the gain is bots. || Visits don't mean profits.

Dotcom investors used to use nonsense metrics about the number of clicks different dotcom websites got in order to value them, but clicks met nothing when the business model wasn't viable. Some websites are just way more profitable or easy to monetize than others. || You think reddit will be the next fb? Ie. Trillion dollars? No, closer to Pinterest or twitter, which we're both disappointing stocks. || ☝️ding ding  || The question was just part of a larger survey on misinformation.  They polled a bunch of UK adults to gain information on how they perceived misinformation, Reddit being more popular was just one of the questions that the article asked in order to gain context about how people perceive misinformation.

Ratings dropped massively for all left leaning media outlets. || Yikes buddy. That is not a good move. || [removed] || It's over yet we're all still here.

If you choose to engage in the content, you're just helping RDDT's numbers. I knew it was time to invest when my wife mentioned going to Reddit to look up some things that interest her. I sometimes use her as a good basis to what's popular lol.

But to believe the election is the driving factor of Reddit's growth, that's like saying the McRib is the reason McDonald's had a good quarter. It may have helped a little, but it's only a small factor to the overall product. Also, if people are coming to Reddit for the first time due to the election then you have to assume it will create return users who previously did not exist. That's how growth is created. It's hard to be a daily user of something and believe it's failing at the same time, or be convinced others are not adapting. || Your negative views on RDDT and many of the sentiment here has given me more courage to buy even more RDDT stocks and I own a lot.  It reminds me of all the haters at IPO who were all epically and confidently wrong.  Position: 1.3m at low 50s cost basis. || I'm glad for those types of comments, sentiment was too optimistic recently for the early stages. || It's just another echo chamber that gets easily manipulated by non-real entities and bots.

Best value in reddit is smaller subs and being able to get answers to questions.

But all social media at the moment is being overtaken by bots and dead internet is real.

For me it's useful for certain information, like other platforms, but all of them make me want to spend less and less time browsing them, || Yeah, because X isn’t an echochamber || UK is turning into Totalitarianism right before our eyes and some people choose not to see it. || Ridiculous 😂 || That comical because on X only the ""free speech“ Musk wants is allowed https://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/12/x-twitter-jd-vance-leaked-file || I’m not sure what you’re trying to say, but that sounds awesome as a Reddit stock holder || Rddt is worth only 25 billion and Meta is worth 1.4 trillion.  If Reddit is Facebook 2.0, then the stock will go up 50x from here. || Yup, there are a lot of really niche/secret subs that I really enjoy! || Yea but those subs are getting overrun by the masses now too. || They key to enjoying this site (these days) is to primarily avoid the front page and broad subreddits like /funny and /pics. The comments there are a cesspool.

Interest-specific subreddits like this are really great sources of useful information. I’ve learned *so* much from /r/Bogleheads, /r/Microgrowery, and /r/personalfinance over the years. || And the users act like robots and post the same things over and over that they have learned are safe and non-controversial so that they get upvotes. Its a total waste of time || I miss the old forums || Doomposts with insane political takes & outright hatred... Yeah who WOULDNT want that... || Do you honestly believe any other platform would change the user engagement to be any less divisive? It's all the same people migrating to another social media space trying to make an argument. Whether it's Facebook, Reddit, X, or any other site, the words will all be the same and the push of content will resemble it. || Ok but how is any of this new? You are saying it’s become too divisive  and the upvote/downvote system needs to be deleted, but that has always been the system? Whats different that’s suddenly making it so divisive now? 

Honestly, it sounds to me more like echo chamber has become a buzzword for “people are saying things i dislike in this area so im calling everything in that area an echo chamber!” It kind of sounds like the same made-up definitions people were assigning to “woke”. 

Sure, some things get unfairly downvoted at times, but for the most part, i enjoy the communication style of reddit over facebook, instagram, tiktok, X, and any others out there. When you get in threads of over 1000 comments in it, i think it’s a good idea that the most upvoted comments get bumped upward on the page. 

Have you ever been in a popular thread sorted by random or new? It’s often just filled with nonsense comments that no one engages with. A lot of people just give lazy, shitty comments and I’m fine with a system that doesn’t showcase the lazy comments at the top of the thread. 

If Reddit is such an echo chamber, why are you here? Whats social media ISNT an echo chamber using the flimsy definitions people use as echo chamber nowadays? || Been here for over 10 years. Most subs feel the exact same to me. || What you don’t think an unflattering picture of Elon musk isn’t worthy of being the highest upvoted post? jk

Yeah this is interesting (my mom mentioned reddit lol)

There was a while where no one really talked about using reddit, or admit to using it online, it seems to be everywhere lately when people talk about their online activity || Profits are what will grow the stock, not how many people are visiting it.

OP's point that ad revenue will drop because of the election being over is definitely a real possibility. A lot of businesses might see this, though I'm not sure historically how much of a drop this may be.

I think it's also likely that some of the user growth numbers posted by reddit are bot accounts pushing misinformation about the election that will likely slow to. Of course from reddit the business's perspective the thing that matters most for the bots is if advertisers will waste money advertising to bots who will never buy their products. But this will also make their ads look a lot less effective if say half the users seeing said ads are bots who will obviously never buy said product. || I've been using Reddit for 10 years. The amount of engagement, upvotes, and quality of engagement has been downward. 

It really dropped off a cliff post election.

Used to be regular posts hitting over 100k upvotes daily in 2016 - 2018. It's not even close now. Even for subs not related to politics, the cryptocurrency sub even during the biggest bull run in history isn't even close to 2017 - 2021 || Buy when sentiment is low. Sell when sentiment is high || Oh, I had no hate at IPO. It was a smart buy due to election season.

You can bet Trump will go after social media platforms that use bots and other fraudulent methods to boost their numbers and engage in political biased censorship. 

Elon knows a lot about what can change in social media regulations, and I'm sure he's gonna push hard for it.

If you don't share that outlook, then yes it's not a surprise that you ended up in an echo chamber on X, just as you have here. || /r/pelicans || I was like wow I've never heard of microgrowery, it must be a sub for small portfolios! || Seeing as they are bots, it's not all too surprising. || Exactly. At least Reddit has a structure where that is mitigated rather than amplified. The community mostly polices itself or moves to new subreddits if they dont like what's happening. If it changed to users having to be verified not anonymous and they got rid of the downvote button, it would become exactly like Facebook or X. || Yes. Because history has proven that the kind of media a society consumes, and the way it consumes it, changes the fabric of the society exposed to it.

Not sure why this is even remotely controversial. We've been repeating the same stupid mistakes for thousands of years now. || > Ok but how is any of this new? You are saying it’s become too divisive and the upvote/downvote system needs to be deleted, but that has always been the system? Whats different that’s suddenly making it so divisive now?

Well first of all, the system used to work differently — it displayed both upvote and downvote totals, not just a sum. This helped to dispel the illusion that a certain viewpoint was unanimous — seeing “+1200 -800” is different than seeing “+400”.

Secondly, people honestly used the site differently 10 years ago. They were a lot less liable to downvote simply because of a disagreement. 

> When you get in threads of over 1000 comments in it, i think it’s a good idea that the most upvoted comments get bumped upward on the page.

Why?? 

This literally means that in a thread about a topic where 60% of commenters think *x* and 40% think *y*, you’ll basically only see *x* because *y* gets downvoted. This is how echo chambers persist.  It means you’re always seeing the most popular take. Is that really how conversations should be?

> Whats social media ISNT an echo chamber 


Classic Internet forums are much more akin to real life conversations because they’re chronological order. Twitter has the “community notes” feature where a viewpoint doesn’t have to be 50%+ to get posted at the top, it just has to be rated as helpful by enough people, and since the platform’s algorithm seeks engagement, often controversial or disagreement takes are right under the original tweet. Reddit is definitely the most powerful echo chamber factory. || Reddit is biased extremely towards liberalism. While that aligns with me more closely than a platform like Truth Social would, you can clearly see that the ideas that succeed on Reddit may not be the same as what succeeds out in the real world - look at the reactions to the US election here vs there.

I didn't say I have a solution, I just know that we have a problem that needs solving. Social media is a concept, if misused, just as dangerous as Nuclear, Biological or Chemical weapons of mass destruction. Humanity needs to get control of this soon. 

Edit: The severe downvoting of this post is proof that what I say is true. Despite stating I'm part of the liberal group, the idea that reddit may not be unbiased is too unpopular so it's downvoted and hidden. Reddit as a whole is left leaning, this is an objective reality. || I've been here for 13+ and strongly disagree. The negativity here has skyrocketed and quality content in niche sub reddits is at an all time low.

Reddit is the new Facebook. People come here to ask questions to argue with each other. || [deleted] || If this is true then you are part of the problem. || For one reign in the ban happy mods. Make it so they have repercussions if they abuse their powers and even doing something as simple as requiring them to cite a rule you actually broke and you could even have a system where the bans are reviewed through crowd sourcing. Imagine trying to run a sandwich shop where you let your employees ban and berate anyone who didn't fully and outwardly agree with their political beliefs, that's a terrible fucking business model. || It's been a ride || to be honest I’m not sure how they polled for this study but that’s how polling works, doesnt it? || That’s literally what polling is. || This guy gets it ⬆️ || The culture is shifting dramatically. We won the popular vote. People are getting tired of the constant rage and drama. 

Turns out it's more fun to be on the other side where actual hope exists. Even when Democrats have control, you all were still miserable. Sad, really. || Do you think that's a lot compared to the US or the world population that uses Reddit? 

California has more than half of that.... || Fwiw I came back to the site following the election to see what people were saying after not using the site for a month and I'm already losing interest. Unless there's another January 6 or something the inauguration and whatnot are not going to drive discussion like a presidential election. || I don't see it. Politics sub look dead compared to pre-election. There's better bets to be made. 

I'm up 50% on JOBY, and it's going to do well, I expect. 

I'm way up on MSTR after buying in Sept. Sold at $500 and got back in on Tuesday before close.  Way up on OKLO because I keep swinging that. It keeps getting shorted down to $18 before pumping again, which happened 3 times for me and sold at $25. It's a nice trade to buy and sell . Way up on Bitcoin. 

Reddit post election at all-time highs is just dumb || Hope you have an exit plan. Good luck. || Do you have numbers to back your claim, or are you just basing it off your observation? Could it mean that those people pivoted to other subs? You're just providing a view from your corner of Reddit without the full oversight of the site. Unless you can provide overall user numbers and engagement, you're just providing false knowledge. || I bet he won’t || You must have never been to rConspiracy or the like. || lololol || what stupid mistakes has Reddit repeated and how would you fix it?  || > Reddit may not be the same as what succeeds out in the real world - look at the reactions to the US election here vs there

I’m not under the delusion that what is said on Reddit is magically the mindset of everyone on earth. However, I’m not going to let the tyranny of the stupid who are overly susceptible to misinformation be the arbiter of intelligence. We have 130 million people reading below a 6th grade level, people not knowing how the economy or government works, they dont know what a tariff is, or that Biden wasn’t even running on Election Day. We are living in a tyranny of the stupid where intellectualism is frowned upon. 

I’m not in the delusion that Reddit is representative of the real world, but let’s not act like the real world is full of reasonable people. || Wants a replacement, has no solution. Reminds me of certain kids on campus that just want a Kumbaya moment. 

Just like in real life, you get to choose which subreddit you go to akin to making a group of friends that think a certain way. 

Just like in real life, you get to leave those friends should have be your choice and find another group.  

Reddit is absolutely the best place to find groups you match with || Reality has a left-leaning bias too. Reddit is not behind the scenes lifting up or moving comments to the bottom, it’s the people voting themselves, not Reddit. Conservatives work off of misinformation and fearmongering so people spouting their propaganda are often highly emotional and shrieking in threads with false information. Meanwhile, liberals work off of unattainable utopia dreams and has too much infighting amongst themselves, which is a flaw but it doesn’t relish in misinformation in the same way conservative outlets do. 

So you can say redditors mostly lean left because it’s the redditors upvoting that content, not Reddit itself 

But also, like i said, the filtering system works most of the time anyways. If you ever look at a thread with hundreds or thousands of comments, you can clearly see WHY people are downvoted. It’s often cause they have poor writing skills, poor argument skills, and often include wrong information or just filled with nasty, hateful rhetoric. 

I am perfectly happy with this filtering system. I upvote good quality comments and downvote lazy, shitty comments. 

Only rarely, very rarely, do i genuinely feel shock seeing a comment be downvoted and think “huh, why is this being downvoted it’s a quality comment?” Most often than not, the shitty comments are the ones being downvoted. 

I think that’s a better system than say Instagram, X, and TikTok in which every comment gets equal merit and drowns out any actual discussions because each comment thread is so removed from the overall post’s thread. || That's just how it has always been,  imo. || I disagree with the redditquette stuff.  I agree it was talked about more,  but people still widely behaved the same as they do now.   Downvote of they disagree or don't like. 

I can get on board with bots being more prevalent. || What problem and why am I part of it?

Are all 10+ year beta part of the problem? || But you will not get a confidence interval that matches the numbers given in this article. || This is a stock sub. If you want to discuss angry politics there's a subreddit for that. || >People are getting tired of the constant rage and drama. 


 People just voted for chaos over calm. They love the rage and drama, people want a WWE reality TV government || So why are people leaving X in massive numbers? || I’m sorry but k don’t think you get how business works. 

You can expand if you’ve already capture the YS market without expanding to other counties || Wow that’s a lot of meme stocks but you’re making a great profit, congrats! Have you read Reddit’s recent earnings reports though? Their growth is not tied to US politics as much as you’d think. Their international growth is great too. And the growth is expected to continue. As a heavy Reddit user who rarely goes to the politics subs, I find Reddit super valuable, I also believe a lot more people will join Reddit because of that. || The fun thing about investing is you can place your money where your mouth is

I think you’re wrong —- engagement is way up and will remain that way while Trump makes the 99% liberal hive mind Reddit furious 

We’ll find out next yr || RemindMe! 1 year || Go to the big subs and sort by top posts of all time.

Look at upvote counts and comments. It's pretty clear || What’s your point || > However, I’m not going to let the tyranny of the stupid who are overly susceptible to misinformation be the arbiter of intelligence.

Lol, as if Reddit doesn’t fit this bill? Go to a subreddit for something you’re an expert on and you’ll find how much bullshit is on this site. /r/science is full of idiotic statistical takes (statistics is my degree). And most political subreddits are full of nonsense too. 

This is basically the whole point being made above you — the echo chambers on Reddit lead people to the conclusion that they are enlightened and everyone else is stupid, because of the constant reinforcement of their own beliefs in their little echo chamber. You’re demonstrating the point if you truly think Reddit is separated from the “misinformation” and “stupidity” || >Reality has a left-leaning bias too.

The funny thing is I can't point out the very obvious things that make this wrong because I would get banned.

It's also funny/sad that Colbert said this in jest and now it's been telephone gamed so much people think it's an actual fact. And being ""left-leaning"" is very different than what it was 10 years ago. || I've been here since the digg days and it's changed drastically. Prior to 2012 or so it wasn't even political, people just got along and discussed shit. Around then it started going downhill because it became more mainstream, it'd be obviously astroturfed, they'd try to monetize the site, etc. then around 2015 it became a shell of it's former self. That's when things become heavily political and the bots and shills (political, viral marketing, everything) overran the site to the point it doesn't even look organic anymore and that has continued ever since. || My point is that the engagement on Reddit, I believe this year is related to politics. I'm sure you're upset and reported me, Karen. || X hit all time highs but many accounts deleted after election. Paid shills or bots. It happened on most platforms 

https://www.yahoo.com/tech/x-lost-record-number-users-212509865.html || Meme stocks... right... || I don’t disagree with your investment in Reddit — I bought it very early and I’m currently up a significant amount. I just find the reasoning behind the investment a bit amusing. I have been a heavy Reddit user for a long time and in my opinion it provides most value to me out of all the “social networks” I use. I’m putting my money where my mouth is too, just from a different perspective. || You're a conservative investing in a liberal shithole. You deserve to lose your money. 

I bought cheap $100 calls on DJT for next year. The price has consolidated nicely. If they announce they're buying a crypto exchange or it goes for another big pump. I'm gonna make a ton.

Is there a realistic scenario where you would sell all your stocks? ,"To be 100% clear, I'm not talking about an Armageddon scenario (Total nuclear war, extinction level meteor etc). 

For me, the only situation I can think of that would have me hitting the sell button would be a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. This would likely bring us into world war 3, especially if it happens in the next 5 years.

For individual stocks, I would sell if I lost confidence in business direction or leadership. || If I was staring outside my window on the morning of 9/11 and saw a plane plow into the world trade center, I’d probably immediately try to sell everything if the market hadn’t reacted yet. Aside from that scenario, I wouldn’t sell. || War is bullish though || By the time you know about it the big boys will have sold and you sell low. || The only thing that would make me liquidate is an alien invasion. || If China invades Taiwan, buy AMAT and ASML. 

the world is about to need A LOT of new semi fabs. || You're completely backwards on the invasion of Taiwan. War is hell for everyone except investors.

Taiwan we'll need to wait a bit and see how Ukraine/Russia war plays out. If China invades Taiwan, they'll see crippling embargos from the Western world. They don't have the food supply to feed their massive population, which means they'd be relying on Russia, their primary fellow authoritarian ally and trading partner. If Russia secures a significant portion of the ""bread basket"" land of Ukraine, that would enable China to invade Taiwan. It would also show that Western support dries up after a few years, if the West's support of Ukraine allows them to continue the territorial stalemate, China will think twice about invading Taiwan. I think they're unlikely to do anything in Taiwan without food supply secured. || Did you sell when Russia invaded Ukraine? If not, why sell when China invaded Taiwan || Yes but they're personal, not geopolitical.

If my wife or I needed life-saving treatment for some disease. If I was fighting a lawsuit or court case where I knew I was not liable or guilty. etc.

Realistically speaking those probably wouldn't deplete my whole portfolio though. || If China goes to war with Taiwan there would be a large sell off. This would present a fantastic buying opportunity that I would take advantage of. Just like I have for 911 2008  covid, 2021/2022 and everything in between. See a pattern here?

There’s no other geo political event. I think that would cause that that’s called panic selling and that is exactly what causes market crashes. It’s like how rubbernecking causes traffic jams, if no one panic sold, there wouldn’t be any crashes, you know it will go back up, and if the issue is is that it’s your retirement funds and it’s close by that’s why you should ease  into something more fixed a certain amount of years out || My entire Roth IRA was TSDD. I sold it all AH on election night so for one day I was all cash. 

I plan to go all cash on Inauguration Day or before possibly. 

My Roth IRA is up 380% YTD (almost entirely momentum trading leveraged NVDA and TSLA) so I could sit on cash for the next 4yrs and still be ahead of average expected returns. Just patiently waiting for another great opportunity. || Sadly, I think the absorption of Taiwan into China will be much less dramatic.  It will involve lots of drama but, in the end, will happen a little like Hong Kong. A timetable, the rich will get out (those who haven’t already), and then, …whimper, Beijing runs Taiwan.  (fwiw, I believe that’s why TSMC is building its best and biggest plant in Arizona). || You never know until it's too late. So the obvious example now is if Trump gets on the tariff pedal a little bit too hard, creates an inflationary environment that turns into demand destruction which then turns into rapidly decelerating inflation but at the same time rapidly decelerating earnings. If that happens yeah you don't want to be in stocks you want to be in bonds but bonds are going to be scary because the initial part of this is likely to see them sell off unless that's what we've already seen because let's face it TLT is not exactly ripping. 

But here's the problem with all of it. Dude could change his mind tomorrow. Everything I just said out the window, everything's fine.

So in other words never. || A Chinese invasion of Taiwan will not start anything the next 4 years. Someone gave them a blank check. There will be no world war || In the event of World War 3, the only recourse would be to place our heads between our legs and kiss our ass goodbye.

No world war would stay nuclear free for long. || If SPY hits 750 next year (only 25%, not completely impossible) I would consider it. But probably just hedge a lot more with OTM put spreads. || I’ve sold majority of my portfolio on 4 occasions, to buy houses cash. Now they’re all paid for and I’m building my accounts back up, to probably just drain them again. It’s a time, lol. || Yes. If a virus starting spreading rapidly somewhere and I thought it was only a matter of weeks or months until another global shutdown. || By the time you learn of a major event the markets would have already collapsed || I recently have, but not for any particular reason other than I wanted to secure profits and better condense a portfolio that was starting to have too many positions. || Aside from long term accounts, like retirement, college, etc., I sell stocks when the return on initial investment has reached a point I'm comfortable realizing the reinvesting in either another growth stock, a long term stock, or if I feel like just buying some random thing || Buying a house. || My kid had to sell all their stock before starting a new job. Allowed to have mutual funds and ETFs but no individual stocks. || If the Chinese invade Taiwan, triggering WWIII, you’re gonna have bigger fish to fry then worrying about stocks. Currencies too will get hit anyways, and gold may be unattainable. Crypto will have issues as well if the internet is disrupted, which it will be if there‘s a world war. || The US government makes a new law to impose strict restrictions on the stock market.  Investors are only allowed to sell less than $10k of stock per day. || Yeah if I go up another 50% this year I’ll count my lucky stars and bow out for a minute || Yes, if they all shot up 50% overnight, I'd liquidate immediately. || Buy a house or make any other large investment outside of the stock market.

I get old and the time value of money is worth less than the experiences I can have with it now

I have advanced knowledge of a market crippling event that won't kill the dollar along with it. || No. || If that’s the case I’m buying Lockheed Martin || Easier option is to not invest much in Taiwan stock market || I’m actually about to sell everything before the end of the year or at least a lot of it to lock in my gains at the rate they qualify (0%, live in a US territory that doesn’t tax gains).  It’s a complicated situation that 99.999% of people aren’t in but essentially if life throws me a curve ball, I want to realize my tax liability or lack there of now.  I’ll rebuy a new portfolio in Jan.  It will be sad to sell some long holds like Nvidia but it needs to be done. || When my future index predictor says ""RUN"" || Already have several times since Covid everyday I read a new article that can convince me to panic sell my entire life || When I am reaching my retirement age, I will be selling and rebalancing into something like a target date fund || Nuclear war and stocks are worth nothing. || Only if they start taxing unrealized capital gains. Then I’m going all into gold and committing tax fraud. || if i have enough in there to pay off my full student loans || Buy KTOS @ $26.95. Thank me later || Trump is going to be really volatile, but since he'll probably appease the libertarian tech bros, VOO will stay strong, so probably just something catastrophic. || Sure. 

- US Government defaults on its debts. Sudden wave of bank failures. Credit dries up. Get what I can for the stocks, put it in gold and live in a cave for the next 20 years.

- Companies just start to get nationalized. Imagine one day, the government just decides it wants to own all of the railroads (for national securities interest). They seize the railroads without any payment, like is standard with eminent domain. Then I don’t know what I own anymore  and want to get out quickly. || Russia uses a tactical nuke in Ukraine. Sell stocks buy BTC. || Yes, for important lifestyle things. House, car, holiday, kids tuition ect. It's very important to take profits or else what's the point. Things can go wrong to. Take small profits along the way. || If I can immediately pay off my debts in relative full then yes.

I've considered a percentage threshold but there's no guarantee it wont go higher with a bit more patience. The same could be said to its inverse though.

I think the difference being I could live with the former and would be stuck wondering what if on the latter. || I’m selling a huge chunk now. This market feels so frothy and so overbought. Trump pump has happened, all my indicators are screaming greed. I’ve got a feeling 2025 is going to be ugly. || No || If they keep hitting my limit-sells, I will keep selling them. Homelessness would cause me to sell them all at in e though, for sure. || If S.4912 - Bitcoin Act of 2024 passes. 

https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4912/text || Nope. WW2 was a good time to invest, who says WW3 won't be? As Warren Buffett says: ""don't bet against the US.""

You can borrow against your portfolio to finance a house. 

Never, ever sell a wonderful company. || World wars, with the right portfolio, create a lot of wealth || If someone got elected who I believed was going to put general tariffs on our three biggest trading partners and deport 40% of construction workers and 30% of farm workers, I would consider getting out of the US market for a little while, yeah. || Bonds yielding 8/10%+ || No || Yes. I just did it. For peace of mind. Also, to reorganize my thoughts. I have tons of losses this year so realizing them is fine. 😂

Besides, after the next brief run up, there's a high potential for divestment into sector pullback. Not guaranteed at all. Plenty of brinksmanship. But everyone is going to go bubble up as soon as the next wind of GDP stagnation rears its head, because that'll mean economic contraction in a potential inflationary run up with low unemployment. That's like the perfect storm setup for stagflation. || It would only make sense to sell if you know before everyone else that China will invade Taiwan. Once it's public the crash will have already happened and you'd have to hold to make sure you don't miss the recovery. 

Many people lose money trading because they get caught up in the moment and forget how the market really works. If you read something on Bloomberg, remember that the hedge funds knew about it hours before you and they've already traded away the advantage. || I've sold all my stocks in the past when prices indicated overvaluation in historical terms and fixed income was paying relatively well. Like now.

I think we're overdue for a recession, and Trump policies provide many possible ways to enter one, and for it to last a long time. So I think there will be lower valuations in the future. || By the way, taiwan would probably not even be invaded. Or at least, they'd first probably just blockade the crap out of taiwan. Like a literal siege. The Chinese military has absolutely 0 experience in warfare whatsoever, especially an amphibic attack like the one that would need to be attempted for taiwan, just look at how bad the Russian military is in Ukraine || Just enough for a house and a car. I would cash out. For me, that’s a big advantage in life on the long run. || Let it ride honestly. I've seen the math behind if you miss the best 10 or best 20 trading days over several decades your gains are pretty much gone. I dont think there's any reason I'd sell everything. Timing the market is impossible (unless you're in congress)

Case in point. Back when my portfolio was worth $250k it jumped from $250k to $300k over the course of a few weeks. I was super heavy in the mag 7 at the time and tesla along with the rest of them went ape shit for a solid month. Had I been in a sold all scenario during that parabolic mag-7 period id have missed out on the big climb gains. || Not sure about China invading Taiwan would result in World War 3. China has stated that Taiwan is part of their country and they will take it one way or another. So it is inevitable. 

  
My only realistic scenario is that I will need all my funds for some sort of health emergency. || August 2007. Pulled all my money off the market after months of hearing about the downfall of the mortgage-backed securities scheme and our government’s refusal to even acknowledge it. The final straw was hearing Hannity and Limbaugh declare it a “Democrat lie” and “keep your money on the market.” That told me which way the GOP was going, the old “bury your head in the sand and pretend it never happened” approach. Really liked McCain as a person after working with his staff a few times, but voted for Obama because the GOP was so toxic. || 6500 s&p within next 6 months || Maybe if I move back to my home country, would maybe sell them before moving to avoid tax. || Sure. When I buy stock and make a deep dive into the company I also formulate an exit condition (i.e. some sort of situation the company is in at which point I think it no longer has room to grow sufficiently quickly to merit my further investment). If all those conditions are hit for all the stocks I own at the same time (which isn't too unlikely since I have only shares in two companies at present) then I would sell it all. 

There might also be some emergency situation where I need a lot of cash (can't really think of one now but maybe some opportunity that is too good to pass up)

(Pretty sure selling your stock would not be an option in an Armageddon-type scenario) || I believe that if I leave my country to another, the government treats my investments and a deemed disposition. So they will tax me on it even if I don't want to sell it. 

So that is when I would have to sell. || No.  

Anything that actually would cause our economy to dissolve would make money meaningless, so why would you care about stocks and other financial instruments? || Retired. I’ve sold 90% to put into monthly cash flow alternative investments. I can see the possibility of putting the remainder of stocks to other uses. || It’s not bitcoin where there is some huge cult making selling some kind of failure. It’s a thing I do to make money || I invest outside of my 401k only for the purpose of raising money for the downpayment and pre-move in renovations of our house. Once we are ready to buy, yes I will sell absolutely everything. || If there were an asset class that was sure shot win. Maybe. || The thing is you would have been too late to press the Sell button. || Idk: if you lost trust in the countries government is something || If one of my side businesses found market fit and I could turn a cash infusion into growth I wouldn’t hesitate for a second to dump my stocks. 

Liquididating for an unproven business idea however I would probably not do. Although that might change as my 401k get meatier over the years.  (its like $140k now and im able to afford the max yearly contribution finally). I keep around $40-60k in non retirement funds, half of that in the markets half in high intestate savings/cd ladders/bonds etc whatever I can get around 5%+ on risk free.  

There is also a world where, say in several years from now I end up with 500k+ in my 401ks. I might quit my job just so I can do an ira conversion then use the IRA to buy a multifamily, with proceeds from rent getting reinvested back into the markets. || I have done this || Are you looking for advice on when to panic sell? || Yeah if I was single and had a terminal diagnosis I'm pulling the plug on the savings and getting a sports bike, sports car and a lot of speeding tickets || At Market open!!!! || Trump winning the election… || Sure, retirement || Hmm, there's this unrealistic scenario where Trump got reelected and is imposing insanely massive tariffs on all trading partners while driving inflation by deporting all cheap labor after the market entered unchartered overvaluation levels? || Yeah if bitcoin hits 1 million then I will sell all of my investments. (Its all bitcoin) || Retirement home, killing a mortgage after fully retiring, big life changes, or an emergency || I cashed out half to buy a home and i may need to cash out some more for a destination wedding. || To buy a house without a mortgage I would. || To buy a home || You only sell if you think it's going to be a sustained drop, and to evaluate that for every stock

worst case scenario you have everything in cash for a year and a half because of some huge recession. And you sit on minimal gains.

reinvesting bits of it carefully.

..............

I think when inflation hit with the virus, one of my more unhinged friends I think yanked out 90% of his crummy stock portfolio

yowling a few times like trying to catch a falling knife

and then he dumped it into a dozen ETF's

questionable stuff like crypto ETF's and Asia Growth lol

Mind you, he bought high risk companies, refused all large-cap stocks as not profitable enough, once person I knew who went into a panic

.........

It's hard to predict an economic meltdown, and how quick or slow it'll act on your stocks || Down payment to buy a house. || Lately I’ve been considering liquidating my brokerage & crypto to buy a 7-plex in a metro that I think has significant upside 1 hour from where I live. Would be about 40% down so I’m sure I could pay the remaining off in 10-15 years. I already own another rental property so have the process down. I am in a great spot with my 401k and company stock as well and real estate is just infinitely more fun for me personally. Something about owning a bad ass downtown brick building that will be a cash flow beast forever makes me happy. Anyways, that’s all I would consider selling for id think. Or a catastrophic issue. || No scenario unless my life was on the line. || >For me, the only situation I can think of that would have me hitting the sell button would be a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.

In which case you'd be selling after the big boys have already sold and no one is buying. So you're selling into a hugely discounted market. Why would anyone do that? It's like selling right after the Covid crash.

So, no, unless I really, really, really need the cash for personal reasons. || Nope if shit critical leverage it for a loan || did it with my personal small portfolio a couple years ago when i got severed from job and took 16mos to find another one, had to keep the bills paid and had way too many bigger expenses in play that ate up the cash. sucked but that was what it was there for if needed, and it was || No, if that scenario happens, war stocks like HII, RTX will appreciate a lot. || Yea. I did it just as the pandemic hit. || I'm slowly selling about 80% because my partner and I bought a house. || When Warren Buffet donates 10 Billion dollars....to me. || Funny.  These events make me think about picking up a HELOC and throwing every single available dollar INTO BUYING MORE STOCKS!!

If there is one thing I have learned about investing...

You make pretty good money sticking to a good passive, static asset allocation of index funds.  You make GREAT money throwing MORE MONEY into that same plan when SH$T is hitting the fan.  When the market is down 2008, 2020, etc... is when I was throwing A TON OF MONEY into the market.  I LOVE IT when the market tanks.  

In the immortal words of Jack Bogle (Vanguard founder) (paraphrasing)... ""Fast do something stand there and do nothing"".  Ponder what he meant and it will make you a better investor. || No || Now.  All indicators point to vastly over-priced stocks, and the economy on the point of a deep depression. Full time jobs down. Gross house, debt, student debt bubbles. Trumps plans for tarriffs and mass deportations will tank the economy and rekindle inflation.  I sold off my stocks. || Why would anyone sell in a potential nuclear Armageddon? Either it happens, and it doesn't matter that you liquidated because you're dead; or it doesn't happen, and you've just sold all your stocks at a huge loss because the market shat its pants. || I’m struggling with a decision. I have enough investment money to pay off my kids’ college loans (they’re my parental loans assigned to me not my kids) in a side RH account, mostly made up of Nvidia. However, I don’t want to touch it for numerous reasons i .e., Nvidia has more money to make me, great financial cushion, etc. I have a pension and I’m still working and putting money into two 401Ks that currently has more than what I owe in parental loans. The interest is about 7% on average. 

I’m 61. Should I pay it off or just make a high monthly payment ($3K) until I die and the loan automatically disappears in my demise? My other option is to leverage the RH account and get a loan and pay off the college loans and just deal with the bank. Interest should be lower. || Recently I made a rash decision to take on financing a car. Had a really nice rate in the dealership, wanted it that night and ended up dropping 1k from my personal bank savings to front a down payment.

I pulled all stocks that I had (this doesn’t include 1k that I put down) to have a safety net for any fees/troubles. If things are safe, I’ll reinvest it.

I think of the stock money as money that grows personally for me, and if I need all of it, I take all of it. Probably not the best idea for some, but it’s working great for me now. || China invading Taiwan would instigate sanctions, don't be silly about ww3.

USA Europe would not go to war over Taiwan despite what they say.

They couldn't keep up an attack around China's waters, their blue water fleet would take major hits and weaken the USA military projection worldwide. || There won't be a world war 3 because of that. The Americans are free to invade any country they want without the risk of starting a world war. || Taxes stop me from selling. Would gladly sell and move to less risky investments, but it’s not worth 40+%. I live in California. || There was a rumor years ago about bail ins if the entire banking system failed. I would try to cash out 100% if I knew that was the case. || Yeah, if I could sense a crash is happening. Then once the dust settles I would put everything in a good leveraged Nasdaq fund and ride the next wave up but this time with leverage. Bear markers average 8-12 months, bull anywhere between 5-10+ and never less than 3 years. In fact the 2 year bull market from 2020-2022 was the only one in history that went less than 3. || End Jan 2020 after person to person covid in Germany || I will 100% in fixed income before Trump raises his right hand. || Currently... I'm completely diversified into $GME. I have some in a broker, and some DRS'ed in Computershare.

I would 100% sell all my shares when the real short squeeze happens...  and then buy back in afterwards. || [removed] || If 10 year treasuries yield above 10%, I will go all in on Bond's. The risk reward is not worth it. || i got guns, ammo and rice. i will use my money to buy your fire sale stocks, thank you very much! || All I can say is that you hit the button that many other smart people already anticipated. But, and big BUT, not everyone may be lucky to know ahead of time. I am lucky. For the broad global population, the hours it takes to realize and grasp, imagine after hours, the markets can open with a 30-70% drop OVERNIGHT and selling is before late. So the key is selling when suspecting it, not it about to happen. Then another problem happens- risk of hyperinflation. All within weeks or until the crisis resolves. So one has to be ready to convert the $$ in real estate (e.g. mortgage payout) or gold. Again, gold will shoot up when it looks imminent. I think I may sell99% of everything and keep 1 unit just to know how much they drop...

And then, if someone has 30% of stuff in options, that cannot be called, what do they do? Shortsellers will be happy.

For your second point, market highs, when approaching a clear correction, should be it or at least 30%. When I watch over a year a portfolio be down 20=30% from a  high, i kick myself for not having sold knowing it was a high. never again especially. || Given how many people are saying tarrifs will destroy the economy, now is a good time. || I was tempted when Trump got elected again. || If socialists like Kamala take power and enact a ""wealth tax"" 

We will all have to sell a large percent of our stocks each year just to pay the tax. || Going through this right now. It hurts as I worked hard to build it all up but hey…another asset class I guess? || Did this in 2022 to buy my first home. Sold about 40% of my portfolio for a 20% down payment on the home. In hindsight it was a great move. Got in before interest rates took off, and the value of my home has gone up $50k in 2.5 years. || I sold ALL my portfolio 3 months ago which was about $80k .We used $30k on a house downpaymeny, but my thought was that we needed the extra $50k on hand if we needed to dig into savings for unexpected expenses or to supplement our mortgage payments for whatever reason until interest rates go down and we can refinance. I'm kicking myself so hard for being that aggressive with selling. I should have kept at least $30k in the market, if anything to avoid paying taxes on realized gains. I learned a valuable lesson this year, which is *if you have the risk tolerance to hold and you have solid investments, then hold.*

It stings even worse that a lot of stuff I had blewww up like Reddit, IONQ, OLKO, to name a few. Now I just need to stop looking at what I WOULD have made if I held..... You live and you learn. Also, FML. || I did that 3 years ago, now laying in bed in the house I own, bought with a down payment I made on shares ( part of it ) || I sold my AAPL stock on 2013 to buy a home… || Same, going to liquidate most of mine for a down payment. It’s absurd how much I need for a “starter”. || That’s what I did in 2022. Good timing but the fomo lately has me itching to get back into day trading. || I sold 75% of my port to buy our house in 2019. In hindsight it worked out, but I was hella depressed about it for the first year (able to compartmentalize it, but didn’t like thinking about it). || Remember how grim taxes are the next year, sold $800k ish a few years back, next years taxes were $200k || I'm going to/want to do the same. This is wishful thinking, but I was hoping my NVDA investment will 10x (in the next 5-10 years), and then I can use that for a down payment on a house instead of having to sell my whole portfolio lol. || This is my plan. I have a house now, but want a big upgrade (double the size). Funds from the sale + most of my investments should be enough to buy one with cash outright or at the very least a mortgage around $100-$150k after down payment. || I sold all my stocks because I needed all that money to buy my home. It was the cheapest one I could find that I wanted to actually live in. Given what I was holding I might have become a multi millionaire if I kept holding for the last 5 years but I probably would have sold after doubling my money and my home has increased in value to the point where I wouldn’t be able to afford buying it today, even if I had doubled my money in my investment account. || I agree. There are those who do not.  On Twitter-X a multitude of obsessive-compulsive people in the investing community there have shunned this idea. They would rather rent all their lives, because they argue more money can be made in stock appreciation than home appreciation. Investing has essentially taken over their lives, become the #1 priority. They may be right about the appreciation, but I’ve used stocks to finance 3 homes, and if I could go back and do it again I wouldn’t do it differently. || Yeah,  I'll sell everything no second thoughts  || For me I wish it would have been when I got 20% above where I needed to be to have a happy retirement. || I’m saving aggressively in CDs and other cash equities for a house the next couple years but I could theoretically double to triple my down payment size if I sell my stocks. Really torn on what to do. || give up cash flow to acquire debt? i rather avoid this scenario. buying a rental is a different story. || Yep! Govt works to serve the rich, who predominately have their wealth in stocks. They will cause inflation to be 6+% before they let stocks stay -30% || So then what's the point if you never sell || I'm not sure I'd be able to tell it wasn't an accident tho || I watched 9/11 live on TV. Even after the 2nd tower was hit, there were reporters as well as many people who thought that it might be some kind of technical issue, not a terrorist issue. So even seeing something happen in real time, we may not grasp the gravity of the situation. || Hopefully you’re not in the south tower || If there's a war with China I'm not selling my Lockheed-Martin. || War is bullish if the war is not happening on your soil, which for the US is always the case || Heh, nice one || Space Aliens like to buy stocks.  If Mars attacks, it's bullish! || 100%. Unless there is a natural disaster of disproportionate scale that materially threatens the survival of the human species, there will always be an opportunity in any crisis.

Like you mentioned, defense stocks are good in war. Even in the Russia Ukraine, oil stocks also saw a solid run due to the economic context of the conflict. If we apply this logic to Taiwan, then I'd assume TSMC is cooked and we'll readjust as such.

Covid pandemic? Pharma obviously. Only thing would be guessing which one gets development done first and the vaccine mandate.

9/11? Defense again. || Thank you. That was an excellent example of the many layers of information that are needed to make informed decisions about investing. || Russia is financially bankrupt and the area of Ukraine that they would get in a deal is essentially worthless without a major costly rebuild.  Right now a large part of China's economy depends on US trade.  Take that away and they have no reason to hold off an invasion.  Trade with Russia will be worthless so their only option will be to use their power to expand into all of SE Asia.  Trump will intimidate to satisfy his followers but ultimately will not push the trade wars. || Some of what you say is true but China has been stock piling grain for years and has more than half the world's supply in reserves and something ridiculous like enough to feed their population for two years. A diet change, maybe, but starving probably not. They are also very efficient in producing grain. Oil is more of a concern for them if anything and a need from Russia. || Iran is another factor here, trump did a lot of brinkmanship and sabre rattling with then last time, and it did result in tanker attacks and that bombing of the Saudi oil field that sent prices up for a bit.  If he does that again, and given his strong support for Israel, he might be inclined to do this again to appear ""tough"".  Fucking with the oil there would increase prices, but might also bail out the domestic oil industry if they have overproduction issues.

On the other hand Iran's president is a moderate right now, and maybe if they make some concessions Trump will back off, but trump is too fickle to make a deal he can stick to, and constantly undermined the negotiations his own people were doing. || But if you have money to buy, doesn’t that mean you are sitting on the sidelines? || Question numro uno. What’s your current investment to sideline cash ratio? Are there moments where, despite seeing market being insanely bullish, yu choose not to invest only to make use of these black swan events for which yu need capital on the side line? || that’s why Buffet is sitting on all that’s cash ? waiting for China to make him even richer ? || Sure but if 30% of S&P caps go bankrupt, one buys not just a selloff but about to die unit... || Just waiting for your tax bill too. || I used to be that way. But the 35% gain in the past year in ETFS alone is a lot to miss out on. || American prestige as the superpower and an ally also depends on what they do with Taiwan upon Chinese invasion. You are being far too smooth about the possibility of a war here. || what about the t-shirts and shoes ? || Doritos is a national treasure. Fuck Fritos || Like CDs or what? || What do you mean lock in losses? Do you sell all of your ""losers"" for the year and keep the winners? Does that have a significant impact on your tax returns? || Is it worth getting smacked by cap gains taxes tho? || Should have bought RKLB instead || Trump would go to war , if Musk and all the other billionaires in his government could profit from it. 

Barron won’t have to go though, he has pre-emptive bone spurs. || when the nukes start dropping we aint selling shit..  money..  especially online becomes inaccessible and meaningless.  guns and ammo are the most valuable currency. || how heavy is your bag? great company though || lol is this still a thing? || You’re not ‘diversified’ in one stock.😂 || Internet Explorer, is that you? || Yes, I too, would go all in on spy returns risk free || So you are a billionaire or weren't paying attention, || Wealth tax would never pass Congress, stop fear mongering || One you can live in || It's like when people ask about stocks that give you some kind of shareholder benefit. Real estate gives you the shareholder benefit of living in the home. || Home > stocks. || Going through the exact same. It sucks to sell almost everything, but yeah into real estate. Plus if leveraged into real estate can get better returns. || Consider using your stocks as collateral to borrow money. You increase risk (debt management) but can help avoid triggering cap gains. || This is just asset swap || Withdraw parts around the end of year and beginning to not have bigger tax hits in one year || If it's any consolation, houses appreciate in value by an average of 10 percent a year and you can sell at any time so it's kinda like an ETF just more complicated, you're not throwing the money away || Yeah, you've not spent the money just transferred it to another form, one that you can make practical use of too. || This just happened to me lol || Take a loan out against your portfolio || Stocks are a means to an end, not an end in and of itself. || You can also shit into a bucket and fetch out your dental crown in privacy. Saved at least $500 there. || Classical smart thinking. Plan to use money within a hort timeline, get the hell out. Happened to me in 2008. Before I went to Miami in July to look for a house to buy I liquidated 100%. Then the great recession happened 2 months later.  Better to be lucky than smart.  
ps: Today, since 90% of my assets are in alternative investments, and 5% in a HYSA leaving 5% in equities, I could sell it all without any immediate or future lifestyle risk whatsoever. || How does it impact your daily life that the value of you house has gone up 50k? Genuine question. I mean, as long as you dont want to sell it. Can you use that more value in some way? || Except you sold at the market bottom…that low interest rate gain means you missed out on 25%+ annual returns over the next two years. Hindsight says you should have taken out a bigger mortgage. || You get my sympathetic upvote.   
  
Your reasoning was sound, and you slept well at night, knowing that you could take care of any house-related emergencies related to finance.   
  
Fortunately, you've still got the knowledge that made you all that stock money, so it's very likely that you'll do it again. || I have about a 60k portfolio now. The city i'm looking to buy in has a grant program that will give me 5% toward my purchase of the place if I meet certain criteria, which I do. One of them is that I can't have more than 50k leftover in investment/savings accounts (not including retirement) after the purchase. So i'm hoping to beef up my savings for a bit and just take out what I need from my investments to get me below that 50k max mark. || Tough to see stocks blow up like that. Similar thing with myself and WGS. Bought 1500 shares at $3.50 and sold it all at $30 only to watch it blow up to $80+. Feel your pain || If I never spent any money in my life, I would be a multimillionaire. Don’t feel bad my dood. The market could have also crashed and you have a house. || Well, what did you buy your home for and what's it worth now? || Yeah can't get a ""starter"" for less than like 350k now. Unless you are in some random place that probably sucks. || No, they don’t.  Inflation is a tax.  Their real basis in a stock gets diluted by inflationary increases in stock price that increases their tax burden. || ...... And because lowering rates in a crisis is good policy... Not everything is a conspiracy man || To generate income from capital || Even in an accident I think you’d want to try to be the first to sell || Yeah it was the second plane that made us all realize the situation. || I've been thinking about buying that stock (and I never buy individual stocks fr) solely bc of how the world is rn || profiting from war is really gross || Well, maybe not always, but like 95% of the time.

Who really wants to invade a country where guns outnumber the residents, 120.5 guns for every 100 Americans, and that was back in 2018, which is 46% of the WORLDWIDE TOTAL lol || I don't know that it's really relevant how much money Russia has in terms of the war as long as the factory workers keep running their shifts to make more weapons and they have more bodies to throw at the battlefield. Agree on the rebuild for industry in Ukraine but farming recovers quickly, and ports have value even if they need a full rebuild. 

I don't think they're holding off due to US trade personally but I'm sure it's one of many factors, I do think SE Asia is ripe for trade with them, their EVs are everywhere there even with 100% import tariffs. I don't know what exactly his motivation is with the tariffs, most of the theories I can come up with sound too adjacent to conspiracies, but I do expect him to implement them on a whim and cancel them on a whim, and some people will make money or consolidate ownership in the process. || Russia is far from bankrupt. || Who has 0% cash on the sidelines ever? Many ways to invest more during a crash immediately or a more aggressive DCA. || I have 20 percent in long term bonds and another 10 in JEPI / spyi. In the flight for safety I can sell the bonds and the hedges covered call portfolio and go long with spy. The timing is tricky. Probably a DCA plan over six months. || You should always have some cash and stock. You really shouldn't be all in on stocks and have 0 cash on hand. Probably a good 30% cash, 70% stocks if you can manage it. || Ok. Whatever helps you sleep at night is your answer. || I mean Taiwan doesn’t really have such intense support that it would create a world war on the scale of the first 2. I think if China started taking it further, like attacking allied ships/ Japanese islands we would start seeing things ramp up. It would definitely cause global instability but also would depend on if it’s a bloody take over or just more of an anexxation || Taiwan doesn't make shirts and shoes anymore. || I assume so; a money manager would handle that part. If your annual cost of living is 4% or less than your current net worth, that’s when your money starts to really work for you. 

My number is $4M. || The war in Syria would suggest that fuel and the ability to produce it is more valuable. Both IS and the Kurds had plenty of weapons but were capturing small oil wells and refineries to run everything. Fuel means mobility, heat, light, tools, cooked food, pumped water etc.. || Yep. Still massively shorted with naked short selling. Still rip for a massive short squeeze. || Obviously… || (comment of the week, right here.) || Why not both?

The wealth tax, like the income tax will expand to cover everyone.  Within 5 years, school teachers will pay the wealth tax. || It’s not fear mongering, it was part of Harris’ platform.  If you remember when Obamacare was passed and Obama raised taxes, Senate Leader Schumer would repeatedly say “millionaires and billionaires” would be impacted with higher taxes.  Then when the legislation was finalized, the magic threshold was $400K.  Now maybe you think if you make $400K you fall into the “millionaire” category, but if you live in a HCOL location, pay high taxes and for childcare, I can tell you you’d be wrong. The point is you cant trust politicians on either side of the aisle.  HW Bush said “read my lips: no new taxes” and then raised taxes.  

The OP asked a hypothetical question about selling.  I ran the numbers on my very large portfolio to understand the tax hit if I liquidated everything if I thought a tax on unrealized gains was coming.  Would I have sold everything?  Probably not. But I would have sold some of my long-term holdings that have appreciated 700%. 

In addition, I would sell everything I own in a heartbeat if I needed the money to help my family with a serious (life-threatening) medical issue. || One that you pay property taxes every year on and insurance. Plus maintenance costs. No thanks. || Is there many stocks these days that offer many benefits? || Also, the missed opportunity cost of not having your down payment invested. || One should hope! My plan is to roll the equity from this first house into a more custom build that will be our forever home. Already have the land...but it's something to look forward to in 10-15 years!

I'm honestly just happy I'm even in a position to get a house...I think my time will be forced to be spent on getting it ready to go versus checking the markets everyday! || I'm in Canada and due to being a first time home buyer with the relevant accounts, I can actually withdraw my entire down payment total tax free. I do have to return the amount specifically withdrawn from my retirement account over time, however. || Is this only for the super rich or can anyone do this || Oh absolutely, I know it will be a solid investment. My partner and I made sure it’s going to be a home first and foremost, but it is in a desirable area so the resell value will be there. Just spooky making those big withdrawals and bank drafts. || Yes, he can’t just liquidate $50k of the value of his house || I’m not sure I understand the intent of what you’re asking. While I sold off a portion of my portfolio to buy my house, another investment, it’s nice to see that investment doing well. || Did not sell at market bottom, lmao. || Ah that means a lot. I slept very well which got me through the first time home buying process with a semblance of sanity. I also put a dollar amount of the reduction in anxiety, which is another way I've rationalized it. Very kind words and a hopeful perspective :) || Oohh that’s a very nice perspective. He does have the knowledge on investments so he can do it again eventually in the future. 

I’m currently considering paying off my housing loan but it would significantly affect my liquidity, in a way that i would need to sell my stocks if there’s an emergency. I’m so torn because I’m anxious not having a proper “liquid” emergency fund if i use my savings account to fully pay my loan. Anyway, still thinking it through. || Thank you for the kind words. That is what my wife said and we ultimately feel good about the decision, even though it doesn't lessen the sting. I am grateful for what I have :) || No offense but this is just wrong.

Buying power gets diluted by inflation. Assets themselves (like stocks, gold, homes) increase with inflation. Incomes increase too but they lag inflation.

So the people hit by inflation are those without assets that have to spend all their money on commodities, rich people who own assets aren't really hurt by it.

I'm speaking straight up observed economics here, not untested theory || Hindsight. Literally everyone thought it was some accident/fluke. || Go for $SHLD defence tech etf with Palantir, Lockheed and more. || You are profiting from war. Show me your portfolio, and tech, and many of them are derivatives from Cold War winning western tech companies... || They use our tax dollars to fund it, so i might as well get something out of it. || - sent from phone made from slave labor || Your name is gross.

I didn't say I want a war with China.  It would be horrible.

This is the stocks forum.  Defense stocks will do well in a war.  This is a fact.  (As they have during the awful war in Ukraine.) 

If you don't like that, go hang out in the poetry forum. || Price gouging essentials sure but stocks nah || But it is American! || If I don't, someone else will.

Moral high ground doesn't pay the bills...that's just life. || Do you like GPS?  What about the Internet?  Military technology does good for lots of areas. || Wrong sub pal || Me has no cash on sidelines.  Any amount is money losing purchasing power. || Me.  || Shouldn't your money be invested? I'm not talking about WW3 where all stocks crash, I'm talking about normal times like now. So if there's a crash of a specific stock (not all stocks), then all you do is sell other stock (which would have been in cash on the sidelines for you) and buy the crash of that stock?

Why leave cash on the sidelines waiting? || Well good thing how we have Republicans who will cause a crash and recession instead || Yes and a wealth tax is unrealistic because it's ridiculous and would never pass congress || Yeah, instead you should pay somebody else's property taxes and insurance. And their maintenence costs. || bro house, gold, voo is all you need at the end of your life. All this shit is just to have that. || Yeah, fuck that system shit. I just relocated to a savannah, living currently alongside cheetahs. Hunting and eating wildebeests and gazelles with self made spears and stone tools. Not a single fucking human being to piss me off around with their attitudes. It’s a dream. || Agree restaurant dumpsters are way cheaper || Around 80% of the S&P500 give you dividends. || If you own 100 shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH) you can get $50-$250 worth of onboard statement credit depending how long the cruise is lol || Pot stocks offer various stages of benefits. || I had two mutual friends who bought land outside of a rural town for dream homes. They continued to pay a modest amount for property taxes until the area was annexed or amaglamated by the expanded regional muncipality as a consequence of the Mike Harris premiership. Then their property tax bill increased dramatically. They continued to hold the land and paid increased property taxes until recently, when the friends both separately had serious health issues. A realtor somehow heard of their health issues and swooped down. He lowballed the first friend badly and then lowballed the second friend less severely for the other piece of property. The two mutual friends sold at fire sale prices, since housing wasn't an issue for them and they were in truly no position to negotiate. I believe the realtor and the realtor's associates knew they were unwell. What especially bothered me was that the realtor bought the adjoining properties for members of his own family. Only after he secured the sale did he produce the documents that revealed the conflict of interest and asked one of the mutual friends to sign a waiver, which the friend did. I hope your able to execute on your plans for a forever home. I'd never, ever invest in real estate for this reason, as an investment as opposed to a place to live, at least not in a town or rural area, because I've seen firsthand how unethically and shady the realtors can act and how fickle the local market behaves. || Just $60,000, not sure that is enough for a 20% downpayment. Maybe it is for a home in a remote part of NB or NFL or it buys you a tiny condo in a third tier town. || Idk what you define as super rich but you most banks have a 50-60% LTV and a minimum line of $200k. || Yeah sorry, I gonna educate myself a bit more. Dont want to confuse anybody but I dont understand what you have from it if the value of your house went up while still living in it. If you dont sell it, you have nothing from it. But if you do sell it you wont have the house anymore. You might have 50k more then before but houses around you went up too i assume. Can you use the property as security and does the higher value of your house gives you more room to play with it? || It’s all a bottom compared to right now. If you sold in Jan 2022 then yes you were at the previous high…. || Just think about the people who have the same problem as you, but who don't have the knowledge or time to revisit the stock market and properly research stocks to buy.   
  
You're making money to improve your life and solve your problems, not to simply keep telling yourself that you have money. || Let me lay it out for you.  Asset purchased for $100. Asset appreciates 10%.  During the same period inflation is 10%. Asset is sold for $110 which is a zero gain in real terms.  However tax is still owed on the 10% gain turning the investment into a loss.  If the investment increases in value 20% the tax is taken on the 20% not the 10% real inflation adjusted gain. It is a real problem with “safe” low return long term investments. || Most people don't know how interconnected technological advancements and the military actually are. Like historically even || having integrity is hard, but not impossible  || Do you have an emergency fund? || I didn't give a percentage that i keep on the sidelines but it's not much. Your method of selling stocks when needed makes sense. 

Im not arguing for a huge amount on the sidelines. My initial comment was to express being against cashing out a portfolio if china invaded Taiwan. My point was that id let it ride and increasingly buy as it goes down. Lump what I can and DCA 

A lot goes into what we want on the side too. Age. Comfort level. People should do what works for them. || Nah he just lives with his parents || This is a terrible mentality to have. When you go to eat at a restaurant or go shopping for clothes or pay for a plumber, you are paying for someone’s property tax/mortgage/insurance/etc. 

You are exchanging money for a service or a good. In this case it’s (hopefully) having a good home to live in + a landlord that’s maintaining the property/fixing issues in a timely manner. 

In most places nowadays, it’s cheaper to rent than to own and if you are able to invest the difference, you could come out on top vs having owned a place. Plus it’s pretty nice that when something breaks, you just call your landlord. When you’re a homeowner, it’s on you || Savannah Georgia, or like a real savannah 🐯 || Never fully understood this. What’s the advantage of chasing dividends over just buying a stock with higher growth potential? || That’s not shareholder benefits, it’s shareholder right. They’re not giving you something that you don’t already own.

Of course this is unless the company offers an extra dividend for some shareholders (like L’Oréal does for instance) || That’s good, because they aren’t showing much upside at the moment. || This is all very sage advice, and that is one helluva story.

The land has been in my family for a long time, which is definitely a blessing. Taxes as it stands are very low, if that changes then we rerack the numbers. We definitely have a long term outlook on the house we just bought and it will be our home first and foremost, not just an idealistic equity vehicle. If the plan pans out in that timeframe, that would be awesome. If not, well we'll be very happy in this house! || What a made up story this is. || 60k from RRSP, then there is my FHSA and TFSA. 60k would definitely not be enough (I also bought with my partner) || You’re correct. It’s pointless as long as you continue living in it. In my country it is possible to use that 50k for renovations for example. When you sell it you just don’t get that 50k because it’s basically a loan from the bank. Not sure about the US though. I see it around me all the time, people bragging about their home value gone up. But have no intention to move anytime soon. || Yes.  You can defiantly do that to an extent.  It would be a HELOC.  Usually it works like this, you would go to the bank and be like ""hey I want x amount of dollars to buy y."" The bank would send out an appraiser (to somewhat make sure the house is worth what you are saying it is) and be like OK sign here.  You are basically selling the equity back to the bank usually at a much better interest rate than going market. 

Mine was going to give me a 3.25% loan.  (Maybe it was only going to be that low because I was using it to do home improvements).  

Just looked deeper into it, yes my bank will let you buy investments with a HELOC.  Nice to know I could have locked in a 3.25% loan then waited and bought a 20 year treasury at 4.625% and had the interest on the HELOC off set some of the taxes owed on the treasury payments making that spread even better. || If I hadn’t started building my stock portfolio in ~2016, I would not have had the money I had to buy the house. Like, yeah, if I just had a shit load more cash on hand it would have been ideal to not have to sell the stock. I don’t know what point you’re trying to make. || Your 10% example is dumb because it's saying, essentially, that stocks will have 0 real growth during inflation and will only ""keep pace"", if you will.

The 20% example is much more relevant. Yes, they'll pay capital gains tax on some of the money that actually just ""kept pace"" with inflation. THEY'RE STILL UP relative to everyone that doesn't have tons of assets, ie the workers that have to spend more for the same goods but haven't had wages keep up and are watching down payments get further and further out of reach 

But let's look at your 20% example. Since January of 2020, inflation has been 22%. S&P500 has almost DOUBLED in the same timeframe, and real estate has gone up more than inflation too. So again... if you own assets inflation doesn't really affect you. If you live paycheck to paycheck it's an absolute killer || If I did, I wouldn't use that for investing during an economic downturn. || Got it.. Basically you're saying while others are going out, you are staying in and putting more in, from the small cash on sidelines as well as additional money (like your job) || Yes, that's why rich people rent and poor people buy right? Oh wait.... || There's more than enough reasons to buy a house, security being one of them.

For me, it's freedom. If I want to tear down a wall, I tear it down. Change the garden? A new kitchen? I can do it when I want and how I want. And if something breaks, I can fix it or replace it or leave it broken. But I don't have to go begging to a landlord. 

So yeah, while.not always the most optimal financial decision, it does not have to be. || Porque no los dos

Different strokes for different folks. || But not all stocks give dividends, so it is a benefit, as is a special dividend.

As a stockholder how do you not ‘benefit’ from receiving a dividend? || It's probably real, but it's not common.

I was in real estate for the last 30 years.  I did see some shady stuff happen along the lines of tricking and pressing people into selling so a realtor could gain all the land she needed for a new subdivision.

But the vast majority of realtor issues are more incompetence based.

Now, most of the shady stuff is outside fraud where people claim they own property they don't and try to list it. || It's not dumb at all.  He just used 10% stock increase and 10% inflation to clearly demonstrate how the inflationary increase in the stock price is taxed, though the value didn't actually increase.  Every asset's price is inflated by inflation, and that portion of the asset's price increase will be taxed. || But you don’t have one at the moment right? What if there was an emergency and stocks were down by a lot? Would you be willing to sell / sell at a loss? || Yup exactly! I probably should've been as concise as you. || If you look at Warren Buffett, he's still in the house he bought in the 1950s. You need a place to live. The best investors don't prefer real estate for compounding. 

Point is don't overspend on a house, it's not the best investment. A book called stocks for the long run proved this by analyzing different asset classes over 50 years. || I’m not saying don’t buy real estate. If its for investment purposes, then great. If its for your personal use, then most of the time it’s 100% a liability and you have to make sure it doesn’t make you house poor. Specially nowadays with high prices and high interest rates, it’s tougher for most people to buy a primary residence that doesn’t make them house poor. || Dividend doesn’t change the valuation of the stock. It’s irrelevant. They’re just giving you what you already own.

lol at the people downvoting. You have zero idea about how to value a company. || I acknowledge your points and I have to admit I'm probably biased by personal experience. Another friend, for instance, simply separately told the realtors where she owned a house in a large Canadian city and another in a small Canadian town she knew what the going rate was for the houses she owned and she wasn't accepting less. She was also a respected professional, on the verge of retirement. She managed to get more than she asked in each sale. But she didn't own those houses as investments, and that is a point I'd emphasize. She owned those houses as places to live, one of which she rented to friends at a slight loss. And the shady stuff: how many people in Toronto with a 416 number have received a cold call from a person claiming to be a realtor asking if their house was for sale. Anyway, at the end of the day, your experience probably provides a better basis on which to make a judgement or pronouncement and my own experience is more or less just that: personal and anecdotal, and causes me to circle back to the point I emphasized. || I probably would, and that bet has paid off for the last decade+, but also I'm fortunate to have dual-income, lines of credit, and very low expenses. || True 🤣 || You'll need to define ""best invrstment."" It's not supposed to provide the ""highest returns."" It's locking in housing costs, being a store of value, and diversification. Home ownership is more valuable than simply min/maxing returns. Its why rich people tend to buy and not just rent. || Man, those gurus on youtube really got you talking all the key words. Did you buy their courses too?


Buying a house to live in is one of the smartest things you could do if you could afford it. Why would buying a house as an investment be better than buying a house for ""personal use?"" It's even more of a liability lol. || We bought an older home and kept the home warranty going which has paid for itself every year. Mostly plumbing issues. 
As we own the house vs renting we have put a lot of money into it which renting you wouldn't do ( painted the brick, the driveway was bad so we poured new concrete as well as widening it).
As owning we have homeowners insurance, and taxes as well as a large water bill due to our beautiful lawn.
I have a list of things that need to be fixed or upkeep.
So yes you do get house poor.
 In an apartment I upgrade it when I move in and put it back to normal when I leave. 
It is nice in an apartment when something goes wrong you aren't sweating in fear of the bill. || Never said anything about the stock valuation. 

The dividend doesn’t come out of the value of the stock , although it does affect it for a period. || Dividends are great, it’s cash on their balance sheet that they don’t see a need for. Might as well be in my pocket. A cash pile on a balance sheet doesn’t actually help much. They already decided they can’t use it for more growth. || And you sounding like a real estate agent telling everyone they should buy a house and its the smartest thing you can do. People are very poorly educated on the actual costs of owning a home (which is just not PITI) and get a big surprise when something breaks 

If you buy a cash flowing property, how is it even more of a liability? It’s literally making you money while your primary home is money coming out of your pocket on a monthly basis. Even if the property breaks even, its still less of a liability || Dividend doesn't come out of the value of the stock??

Where does it come from then? Please explain."
