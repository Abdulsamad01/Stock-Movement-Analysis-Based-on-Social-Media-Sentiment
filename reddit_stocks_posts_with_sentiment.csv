collectively the gold mining stocks make up a commodity basket and should be regarded as a single investment due to the inherent risk in junior miners and dearth of information available its best to use a basket as a proxy for gold before the end of the year i will shift around the weightings and add new companies as well  seeking guidance from experienced investors  

everything i learned about investing has been on my own not much of a support system in my family im 36 years old the best thing ive done so far was during 2020 i bought all airliner stocksnvidia shares at discount 

couple years ago i sold half of my shares of nvidia to help pay off debt its been real tough out here with inflationcol and all that noise 

holdings 250 shares of nvda left 
                 27 shares of intc

ive got a great retirement from work pension401k balance is with both 375k at my age and growing 

im looking for advice on where to expand im going to be contributing about 1600 per month to buying etfs i have 8000 right now to invest goal is to use my earnings to help purchase my first home garner more knowledge on stocks etc

i was looking at expanding my nvda intc holdings im optimistic on intc

 q1 should i perhaps step up the gas and go to 5050  from 4060 
 q2 for the play money part would you suggest any addition  deletion 

ps  forgot to mention 3 of this 20 06 overall is used for options a to hedge b to satisfy my fomo and casino instincts i dont write options only buying them to someday hit a jackpot  name 3 i need to get rid off and 3 i should add to improve riskreward

overall return since march 2024 is 1714 and until just recently ive only held bought shares and havent sold any shortterm but im looking to start doing more research to buysell in shorter time periods

  
planning on holding kscp til q3 of this year they ran a whole corporate restructuring which gave negative earnings the last year and a half and relisted themselves after being at risk of delisting from nasdaq but ive attended lots of their public shareholder meetings and feel confident about them rising in the year with the number of renewed contracts they received  partnering with verizon just a week or so ago  i have 36k spread amongst 7 companies aapl meta ionq rgti nvda msft and amzn i am at 916 gain so roughly 19k invested 
would i be better off focusing on one high growth potential company for example im up 95 on nvda but only have 5 sharesso should i focus more on position size goal is 100k next year at this time i know its ambitious but why not  personally i like your portfolio you have clearly done well  i think there are a lot of people on here that say put it in an index fund and relax and there is nothing wrong with that  you seem to want to be more active  my only critique would be that is a lot of stocks to manage  personally i would trim it have some stuff that you dont have to worry about and then maybe 5 big swings that you can go deep on dad and have a bigger portion dedicated to it  my portfolio performance

bottom 10 httpswwwredditcomrstockmarketseddhggzfdk

top 8 httpswwwredditcomrstockmarkets05s0obhzc9  i like the attitude and at age 54 i also love analyzing individual stocks as a way to expand knowledge and horizon even though i know there is a likelyhood i willl not beat sp500 long term also like the portfolio lots of high quality  growth some financial infrastructure like visa moodys etc might be a place to look next or maybe some medical devices companies  also a lot of wide moat and high quality to look into there keep up the quest for knowledge and good stocks   this is a bragbot  no way 18 yo has patience to hold these stocks for over 6 months i know i checked prices daily and sold within a month  to many to keep track and up to date  deleted  may i ask which additions were most recent curious what you are buying now  why psix good catch early on   mitsubishi heavy industries 

whats the bull case for mitsubishi is it just good value or is your thesis based on some geopolitical shifts in its favor japan allow weapons exports etc  whats your gold thesis and why near term everyones quite bearish the bulls discussing inflationary policy etc always sound a bit too conspiratorial to me i love your low cost underpriced picks though  i approve of igic its one of my top 3 insurance picks what made you choose them  is the rationale behind nlcp that youre bullish on the cannabis industry or just like the companies financials  stick to nvda dont get greedy with speculative stocks nvda is a proven company with strong cash flows and growth odds are they are going to continue beating the market for years to come less momentum as years progress obviously  careful regarding qubt recent information came out making it a risky play for quantum computing i would look at rgti ionq or d wave   i like the high quality mega cap companies that you have i would caution against soxx as semiconductors are cyclical wall street might rotate into it but they may rotate out and crush you not a bad entry point into soxx right now though recommend just concentrating in nvda  i dont understand people building portfolios like this of 15 plus stocks just buy the sp500 man the probability that youre going to beat the index exponentially decreases as you add more and more stocks beyond 810 buy the sp500 and 23 high conviction plays where you feel theres alpha the rest is a waste of time and will likely just lead to you underperforming  i dont think this is bad but 1 what is your thesis for an ew turnaround 2 while i know theyre not applestoapples id say consider choosing zts or idxx and concentrating in one or the other 3 its bounced lately but whats the mediumlongterm thesis for payc 4 would rather tmo or rgen than a but its not a bad company 5 would actually rather diversified bkng than abnb  very bad selection overall sorry just my opinion are all your funds parked in these or hopefully just the play money 


 sell  booking ftnt visa suggesting to book profit where pe is 30 with a good run up 


 buy  amd and an index etf   are there competitors to square is it stripe i feel like there are already some big players in the payment handling field going up against  are you hoping they get purchased seems like a lot of the pie to give to them maybe im wrong though cant go wrong with voo and i think google too  i mean quite focused on those two companies with a sprinkle of diversification through voo if you can stomach a potential downturn on the 7 figure portfolio  heres a breakdown of your mix httpsinsightfolioenportfoliosreportbc3c1b7e31httpsinsightfolioenportfoliosreportbc3c1b7e31  why square  bro bought an sp etf and then decided to buy every stock in the sp individually  too many etfs  stick to 34 max voo  qqqm  avuviwm small caps is a good mix  stick to 100 voo  retired at 40 if you dont mind me asking what is the net worth of this portfolio you would need some capital growth for the next few years right unless you are at 5m then you could do well  really solid portfolio actually welldiversified why the allocation in dis and visa also would recommend not investing in afk and opt for something like inda india now africa will definitely have its time that time just isnt now  im not entirely sure on your risk profile but i would do most in vooqqqm if youre feeling risky throw in more nvdagoogl sgov for the safe money an allocation in avuv small caps for some diversification away from the mega caps  m20 university student  i like these names why ma gs unh and cmg  just stick to mag7 and sp 500  ionq and rgti are too speculative for me look at valuations for mag7 most enticing for me are nvda huge growth prospects and googl value pick meta and amazon are positioned well too  actually i just have pretty good patience to sit and watch them grow though most of the time i have some cash on hand to buy a little here and there but most of the stocks are bought with long term hold in mind with the possibility for a little rebalancing once in a while  i have lots of time so i would not say around 15 i too bad  that was literally the one thing i said i did not want  i bought mhvfy wrlgf afmjf and btai today wdoff and sand last week i shaved down app to 66 of the original stake to reinvest in those companies  both the company has excellent growth prospects and poor financial accounting that understates its operating profitability by around 13x  monetary debasement due to reliance on debt to simulate gdp growth separate from the regular structural drivers and the international desire to establish mediums of exchange with no counterparty risk deflation will create a worldwide crash in asset values of historical proportions as well as a credit crunch that will leave the banking system insolvent therefore inflationary policies will be pursued instead this is not a conspiracy  its the logical conclusion of incentives baked into the cake think about why the government despite claims the us consumer is resilient and the economy is strong is deficit spending as if we were in the midst of wwii deficit spending is supposed to be countercyclical

people arent really thinking about the evolution of monetary institutions in the longterm theyre extrapolating stalled momentum as a thesis 

golds upper price depends on its theoretical function when incorporated into the current monetary order ive heard estimates ranging from 5000 to 20000 based on mean reversion to various ratios goldtreasury coverage goldgdp coverage etc

 i love your low cost underpriced picks though

thanks i owe a debt of gratitude to john hussmans work on longterm portfolio performance for shaping my stock preferences  both however im not interested in direct investment cannabis companies are already struggling to produce appreciable margins since the product is so commoditized nlcp is my picks and shovels approach to the industry one that can consistently produce fcf regardless of tight or loose economic conditions 

it has stagnated more than i assumed though depending on the state of the industry in 2025 i might drop it for another dividend payer with better growth opportunities  concentration builds wealth diversification protects it  huh

most tech and emerging markets investors ive seen buy 2030 stocks due to the volality and some losers some winners

im new explain why that isnt a good idea  never thourght of that great advice thanks  thanks very good inputs and questions 1 ew has rerated because of a temporary slow down in growth but it is fundamentally a great and profitable company last 20  years with stable and high roic and i count on long term secular growth to pick up again from 2026 the huge dip in ew share price was partly because of an overreaction fear of obesity medicine willl cure heart desease but i think the opposite will happen   more people will be able to actually get treatment when they loose weight 2 zts  idxx i have held zts for a long time and it is a stable core position idxx is a recent addition it has only traded at these multiples very few times since 2017 it has a solid marked position so i figured it to be a good time to diversify instead of keep adding to zts both zts and idxx are fundamentally well run businesses with stablerising margins and i think they are both still here 20 years from now 3 payc along with bill was my play on smallcap instead of trying to find a basket of ussmallcap why not invest on those who will benefit from smallcap taking off both have played out almost perfectly in 2024 but even after huge gains are still trading at reasonable price compared to expected growth i have worked with hrsoftware and know exactly how hard it is to switch and i think the payc strategy of providing walltowall for smaller companies has benefits compared to the other vendors in the space it is tempting for smaller business who have a hard time finding ressources to manage their integrations but once they are on board the lockin is stronger 4 good call i have my eyes on tmo as well  waiting for a price in the 1618 evebitda range and may have a critical look at a to find the money 5 waiting to see what abnb will do with their huge war chest   thanks considering amd already ftnt and bkng are two of my biggest winners and i could take profit since i agree they have become a bit expensive  i understand my way of investing is peculiar but i found screening and imaging the futures of companies so interesting  i live pretty frugally and i own my house and car no dependents yeah i want to try and grow what i have so that i can be less careful with my money in later years my us portion was in vti and qqq until very recently and i moved them to vdc and sgov  thanks

ive been holding visa for 3 years in my margin account because i wanted a safe place to put usd and now that its grown by about 50 i dont want to pay taxes on the gains right now but may take them early next year

disney was a purchase i made because i was happy with the companys brands and felt like their situation was going to improve postcovid but it hasnt and now im still down 17 im not necessarily opposed to moving that money to something more likely to improve its just getting over my irrational dissatisfaction of cementing existing losses

afk was a tip from a friend that did not pay off and im kinda just holding the bag in hopes that it improves so that i feel less bad about it  i dont take tips from him anymore though same with ntr actually  i was in vti and qqqm until just recently and trying to play it a bit safer to ride out the political uncertainty i plan to get back into those after the next pullbackcorrection  ma  i believe it has a durable moat
gs  bought it back in october 2023 when valuations were at multi year lows
unh  similar to the reason for gs and a durable moat
cmg  liked the food and the revenue growth  ive got most of my money in fxaix that loosely tracks the sp500 but im using the smaller amounts to trade for smaller amounts that i can use more often  you are not probably doing thorough analyses and dd at more than 10 but just going with flow and got luck reading news articles 

but congratulations and hope you luck still runs good  dont let others discourage you this is a great starting portfolio and 15 stocks is a good amount my only recommendation is diversification youre very tech heavy

you have many blue chip stocks in your portfolio that doesnt require daily tracking youre also not a day trader you literally can literally just buy and forget i mean no ones gonna sit there and research procter and gamble pg every week  deleted  how long do you plan on holding mhvfy bought in a few weeks ago as well do you have a specific price targetfair value  im always a bit wary of japanese companies as they have a history of bad governance keiretsu cash hoarding bad handling of small shareholders etc even if it looks cheap sometimes you just dont get the value unlocked then on the other hand i see the company is mooning since 2024 and japan is pushing for corporate reforms so there is a chance  if you concentrate your portfolio into fewer stocks you have a higher risk but also get higher returns

ex if i bought nvidia pre split at 500 a share 50 equivalent in post split and i bought 1k of it 2 shares pre split 20 now id now have 1740 in return if i did the same with the sp or an index id have less if i made my own index with 15 stocks and the other stocks didnt perform as well which is likely id be losing out on profits

keep in mind the example is a bad idea too you shouldnt only own 1 stock just explaining the concept with a slight hyperbole  understandable not hating just having a laugh  haha hope youre still friends with that friend hes only trying to help i would stay overweight on us equities and would only consider emergingdeveloped markets if the us economymarket weakens that said the world shakes when the us sneezes africa will have its time but thats decades away and also just because the economy of a country improves significantly doesnt mean youll be able to capture the gain through the public markets sse composite index shanghai is only up 380 all time dating back to 1995 chinese people got wealthy through real estate not stock  for individual investors for the long term i would highly consider the magnificent 7 stocks apple microsoft nvidia meta google amazon tesla they all have a cagr that is higher than the sp 500 the past decade any percentage higher that you can get more than the market is extremely valuable as those returns will compound over time 

when apple became the most valuable company in the world in 2012 and you invested in 100k in it you would have 965552 today versus 346234 apples cagr is 2569 and sp 500 is 1334 sometimes the best way to make money is right in front of you most people dont realize that most people are underinvested in nvidia they think that nvidia is too expensive and that the train already passed sure the best momentum has passed but the growth is still getting started

these companies have such strong economic moats and people underestimate their globalization effects everyone and their mom is using american technology these will only compound

short term these stocks are definitely volatile but with a buy and hold strategy you should outperform the market over an extended period unless a huge disruption takes market share my picks for today are something like 50 nvda 30 googl 10 amzn 10 meta tslaaaplmsft dont have attractive valuations for me at the moment  it may take longer than you anticipate for a pullback to occur it takes humility in saying that you dont know when the next pullback will happen best to stay invested if you have cash when pullback happens add then  i am doing analysis and dd but ofc not every day for every company daily im just looking at news with a deeper dig every quarter or if some big news comes 

these are positions built over a year not all bought in the same day so i have had pelts of time to choose  thanks man  i am pretty tech heavy but on other hand i personally think that the tech stocks that i have are still at a pretty fair valuation and i believe in their continued growth in the future but i am definitely also looking to add more outside tech 

i like the mix of blue chip stocks that i feel can still outperform the market as a base and some smaller stocks as potential high flyers this also leaves me some more time to really lean about the smaller companies as i can look at the blue chips once in a while and judge if my investment case still stands while on the other hand the smaller stocks are more engaging and you cant just be passive 

procter and gamble i have as my ultra safe stock which makes the red days a tiny bit better while it has still performed pretty decently  i think its better to take risk earlier in life my time horizon i longer and its not gonna impact me if i loose 40 like it would if i had a house and family and yes i did start in a bull market but i would not bring it all down to just luck i am lucky to be surrounded by people who have great knowledge about stocks who have also helped me learn 
even if you take the outliers worst and best performer out i would have still outperformed i like that i can take a higher risk than if i bought and index even though that probably will lead to underperformance i bear markets it will hopefully lead to outperformance in bull markets  longterm i expect it to double at minimum  its expensive according to asreported metrics 31x pe im saying its a lot less expensive than what those suggest mhvfys real pe is around 6x  sure but my strategy is more akin to buying multiple lottery tickets somewhat more like investing in startups but i guess i should put more into rheinmetal etc  so do you think it is the best solution to sell off all individuals and buy some etfs or tb in case the market falls  thanks i appreciate you spending time reviewing and giving advice  i agree with this strategy be more aggressive early in life and transition to etfs later in life after youve built a significant nest egg just be sure to diversify i lost six figures in my twenties 401k when the tech bubble burst it was a fun ride on the way up but took 10 years to recover  deleted  also i noticed theres multiple related tickers do you by chance know what mhvyf and mhviy are  if youre trying to establish a stake in convexity setups then your allocation needs to be weighted to reflect the riskreward tradeoff the principal distribution feels very random  if i knew the best solution id be doing it personally id stick to 13 etfs for at least 80 of the portfolio playing with the other 80 is fine but i wouldnt waste time having less than say a thousand bucks in a company anything less and even if it doubles youre not seeing much of a gain  of course  removed  mhviy looks like an unsponsored ads mhvyf is probably the adr  i do put in different amounts depending on risk and my belief in them so i have jumia for a small sum and rheinmetal for more  thank you for your reply at first i bought individuals with a quarter of my cash the rest went into etfs but thanks to the rising market my portfolio was distorted i know i should follow your advice but i want to gain experience and knowledge of the market rather than profit fortunately even if i invest 80 of my money exposed to the market there will be more than 10000 left then i would like to get ideas on how to improve my portfolio

  
ive already decided to sell what we call meme stocks but there will be more than 40 brands thats what i feel it problematic  deleted  gotcha thanks what brokerage do you use if you dont mind me asking  yeah thats fair also remember you can paper trade and that way your money isnt at risk and your learning experiences dont potentially push back your retirement 

you could always look for exits in the ones you arent as optimistic about anymore i personally cap the total number of stocks in my portfolio to about 10 but its flexible try to avoid developing an emotional attachment to any of them if you had to rank them right now the bottom 20 should be easy sells sometime in the next year from there you can take time to really do you due diligence on the remaining ones and rebalance as needed  why comment something that does not matter i asked for opinions on my portifolio and now you start to generalize why comment if you have nothing meaningful to say about what i ask  etrade  deleted  weird i dont see mhvfy on my e trade either do you know which would be the equivalent to your ticker",0.9558,1.0,1

Amazon sued by DC attorney general for allegedly excluding neighborhoods from Prime delivery,"washington dcs attorney general sued amazon on wednesday accusing the company of covertly depriving residents in certain zip codes in the nations capital from access to primes highspeed delivery

the lawsuit from ag brian schwalb alleges that since 2022 amazon has secretly excluded two historically underserved dc zip codes from its expedited delivery service while charging prime members living there the full subscription price amazons prime membership program costs 139 a year and includes perks like twoday shipping and access to streaming content

amazon is charging tens of thousands of hardworking ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide schwalb said in a statement while amazon has every right to make operational changes it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one zip code is worth less than a dollar in another

in june 2022 amazon allegedly stopped using its own delivery trucks to shuttle packages in the zip codes 20019 and 20020 based on concerns over driver safety the suit states in place of its inhouse delivery network the company relied on outside carriers like ups and the us postal service to make deliveries according to the complaint which was filed in dc superior court

the decision caused residents in those zip codes to experience significantly longer delivery times than their neighbors in other district zip codes despite paying the exact same membership price for prime the lawsuit says

data from the ag shows that before amazon instituted the change more than 72 of prime packages in the two zip codes were delivered within two days of checkout that number dropped to as low as 24 following the move while twoday delivery rates across the district increased to 74

amazon has faced prior complaints of disparities in its prime program in 2016 the company said it would expand access to sameday delivery in cities including atlanta chicago dallas and washington after a bloomberg investigation found black residents were about half as likely to be eligible for sameday delivery as white residents

the zip codes in schwalbs complaint are in areas with large black populations according to 2022 census data based on its american community survey

the federal trade commission also sued amazon in june 2023 accusing the company of tricking consumers into signing up for prime and sabotaging their attempts to cancel by employing socalled dark patterns or deceptive design tactics meant to steer users toward a specific choice amazon said the complaint was false on the facts and the law the case is set to go to trial in june 2025

according to scwalbs complaint amazon never communicated the delivery exclusion to prime members in the area when consumers in the affected zip codes complained to amazon about slower delivery speeds the company said it was due to circumstances outside its control the suit says

the lawsuit accuses amazon of violating the districts consumer protection laws it also asks the court to put an end to amazons deceptive conduct as well as for damages and penalties

to get packages to customers doorsteps amazon uses a combination of its own contracted delivery companies usually distinguishable by amazonbranded cargo vans as well as carriers like usps ups and fedex and a network of gig workers who make deliveries from their own vehicles as part of its flex program

amazon has rapidly expanded its inhouse logistics army in recent years as it looks to speed up deliveries from two days to one day or even a few hours in july the company said it recorded its fastest prime delivery speeds ever in the first half of the year delivering more than 5 billion items within a day

in relying on its own workforce amazon has assumed greater control over its delivery operations

in his complaint schwalb cites an internal company policy that says amazon may choose to exclude certain areas from being served by its inhouse delivery network if a driver experiences violence intimidation or harassment the company relies on ups or usps to deliver packages in excluded areas

source httpswwwcnbccom20241204amazonsuedbydcagoverexcludingareasfromprimedeliveryhtmlhttpswwwcnbccom20241204amazonsuedbydcagoverexcludingareasfromprimedeliveryhtml",Puginator,2024-12-04 19:23:24,45,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h6gi97/amazon_sued_by_dc_attorney_general_for_allegedly/,,"whos the bigger dirt bag here amazon for taking the money or the lawyer suing because amazon wont send its underpaid workers into harms way to deliver someones socks fast enough jesus wept  next up  chinese and pizza restaurants sued for not delivering to the people who keep robbing them  they really are trying to sue mag 7 for literally anything  imagine actually policing these areas instead of suing amazon for not being willing to get robbed  interesting  i used to live in 20019  its a pregentrified neighborhoodward but very diverse  some of it is very suburban wider streets craftsman style houses there is a concentrated area downtown which has a number of apartment high rises and some shops and there are some larger projects notably kenilworth in 20019 and barry frams in 20020 which although i ventured into a number of times arerough

its a really complex problem its in part of dc called east of the anacostia river or eotr and has historically been an impoverished black part of the city even in the 90s when all of dc was rough this area was the worst of the worst and because of the river its remained sectioned off and even despite investments from dc has been the slowest to proper in the thriving dc the same reason that amazon doesnt want to deliver there is the same reason its a food desert  crime the most egregious corporate offender though was walmart who agreed to put 2 stores in 20019 and 20020 back in 2017 if memory serves in exchange for puting stores in more affluent parts of dc they built the stores they wanted and then reneged on the 2 others and saw no consequences

i understand why amazon doesnt feel like its safe to deliver there but i had prime when i lived there and it helped tremendously to offset the foodshopping desert there needs to be stronger representation trayon white down in 20020 for example is a criminal who keeps getting relected and more advocacy groups need to be vocal about the issues in this part of dc

i know this is a stock sub  this will be an immaterial lawsuite for amazon  but its a major social and political issue that many urban areas across the country face these large companies need to be held at least somewhat accountable to provide equal services they certainly get preferential treatment in our society they should be helping to solve these issues not contributing to them they certainly have the capital to do so

quick note i loved living in 20019  understanding that i have a different perspective i am privileged good income white male  the neighborhood was warm and welcoming we would help each other out and there were many genuinely kind people i would not hesitate to return at a different stage in life  bullish  i wonder why the da isnt trying to solve the root cause of this issue crime rather than the symptom companies trying to avoid crime 

if crime in those zip codes got on par with others it seems like that would be a resolve all of the issues and many more  charging for a service theyre not providing is wrong  but not wanting to deliver packages in se dc totally understandable  

source  i grew up in this area  amazon should counter sue stating that dc has failed ward 7 and 8 residents by not providing basic safety policing to ensure companies like amazon and their workers feel safe to deliver packages  not surprising but definitely disappointing  i expect this to open up to a class action at some point amazon does this all over the country and not just in high crime areas im in a gated community and for the last 2 years i havent received a single package in less than 4 days i actually stopped ordering from amazon because ordering direct from the actual company almost always ships faster  dc ag instead of fixing the problem he is going after amazon  its not just there and not just because of the drivers being robbed  this was a business decision made by amazon they do this in less populated regions all over the us  i live in central florida in a gated community and about 2 years ago they started doing this  i cant get anything delivered in less than 45 days  while the system laughs in the corner  big difference when theyre subscribing to amazon prime but get less of the benefits its a bad situation all around though  its their new checkbook  issue here is amazon charging these people for primedont offer it in the non covered zip codes  its almost like dc should focus on reducing crime in those areas rather than getting upset about food deserts and lack of prime shipping

capitalism works really well  make those areas attractive to do business in and the food deserts will disappear when crime is allowed to run rampant no one should be shocked that businesses choose to do business elsewhere

the circa2020 activism pushing the idea that policing crime is bad actually has done and continues to do irreparable harm to cities prosecute crime the fullest extent of the law and put criminals in jail its really that simple  our taxes pay for our police subscription though  yup amazon should exclude not safe neighborhoods ez fix but looks bad lol does usps have the issue there  youre living up to your username i see 

i think there are certainly reforms needed in dcs justice system  especially as it relates to juveniles  but eotr is a textbook definition of systemic racism in america when people who have mostly lived in affluent neighborhoods or at least more suburban white communities try and poopoo the concept of systemic racism oh blacks gonna black or they can vote racism isnt a thing anymore its because they havent been exposed to places where its truly an issue

ward 78 these zip codes was literally sectioned off from the rest of dc by a riverthen they added major highways to further section it off it was the literal city dump for decades had a powerplant that contaminated the river still recovering that people used to sustain themselves police wouldnt police the area for decades there were open air drug markets the schools received zero investment its created lost generations of kidsadults and a cycle of poverty that cant be broken by hur dur more police  exactly amazon should sue dc to require them to uphold basic standards of safety that the rest of dc enjoys that allows companies like amazon to deliver packages  poor people dont pay much taxes  robbingattacking a mailman is a felony and will completely destroy your life lol i assume amazon delivery workers do not have the same protections  this is true but they pay for amazon prime apparently  good point man if usps gets privitized the poor people really will never be able to vote",-0.9153,-0.9946,-1

remind me to never trust barclays again i guess  boring answer but all the political kerfuffle has already been mostly priced in  cac has underperformed in 2024 compared to other eu indexes  dunno about france but look at which german stocks are doing well and are the dax largest contributors and youll know why the dax is fine

sap is basically tech and global deutsche telekom is solely driven by tmobile us siemens is global and us is doing fine lots of insurers reinsurers a few banks and defense not really constituents of the common man economy a huge chunk of german economic output comes from smallmid private companies mittelstand

iirc france is huge in defense and aerospace so that might be a reason for them as well  look at the romanian stock marketit literally crashed since an nazi using ticktok won the first round for presidecynever before something similar happened

"GM expects more than $5 billion impact from China restructuring, including plant closures","general motors expects a restructuring of its joint venture operations with saic motor corp in china to cost more than 5 billion in noncash charges and writedowns the detroit automaker disclosed in a federal filing wednesday morning

gm said it expects to write down the value of its jointventure operations in china by between 26 billion and 29 billion it also anticipates another 27 billion in charges to restructure the business including plant closures and portfolio optimization according to the filing

gm which previously announced plans to restructure the operations in china did not disclose any additional details about the expected closures

as we have consistently said we are focused on capital efficiency and cost discipline and have been working with sgm to turn around the business in china in order to be sustainable and profitable in the market we are close to finalizing our restructuring plan with our partner and we expect our results in china in 2025 to show yearoveryear improvement gm said in an emailed statement

gm said it believes the joint venture has the ability to restructure without new cash investments from the american automaker

a majority of the restructuring costs is expected to be recognized as noncash special item charges during the fourth quarter that means they will impact the automakers net income but not its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes  a key metric monitored by wall street

gms operations in china have shifted from a profit engine to liability in the past decade as competition grows from governmentbacked domestic automakers fueled by nationalism and as a generational shift in consumer perceptions of the automotive industry and electric vehicles takes hold

equity income from gms chinese operations and joint ventures peaked at more than 2 billion in 2014 and 2015

gms market share in china including its joint ventures has plummeted from roughly 15 as recently as 2015 to 86 last year  the first time it has dropped below 9 since 2003 gms equity income from the operations have also fallen down 785 since peaking in 2014 according to regulatory filings

gms usbased brands such as buick and chevrolet have seen sales drop more than its joint venture sales with saic motor wuling motors and others the joint venture models accounted for about 60 of its 21 million vehicles sold last year in china

prior to this year the only quarterly losses for gm in china since 2009 were a 167 million shortfall during the first quarter of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic and an 87 million loss during the second quarter of 2022

the detroit automaker has reported three consecutive quarterly losses in equity income for its chinese operations this year totaling 347 million that includes a loss of 137 million during the third quarter

these smaller cap stocks are obviously a bigger risk since a lot of them still are not making money but the growth is very appealing

their moa is the same as tirzipetide lly product and consequently has nearly identical results some may argue better 

the 40 drop is mainly due to the fact that there are mfg concerns nvo and lly have suffocated supply for the next 3 years with massive spend however this would only need to be for the 2515mg dose injectible not for their 100mg oral product which is a few yrs behind vktx has 900m in the bank that needs to get them through p3 trials and launch this is doable

with this weeks amgen data being suboptimal merck trying to get into the obesity game with a differentiated product and keytruda coming off patent in 2 years and pfizer desperate for a cash cow after awful acquisitions vktx is looking like a prime candidate for at least a partnership if they dont attempt to push this alone 

if they go alone expecting 10b in annual revenue is not a lofty goal 

lly already tried to buy at 50share 

you are likely witnessing a coordinated attack to cool the stock but to think this is a given 3x bagger is foolish  pretty much every publicly traded company faces class action suits and investigations by law firms for biopharma specifically since trial results are huge catalysts for large swings in their stock prices it is extremely common for them to face class action suits and investigations following positive negative results announcements especially for small prerevenue firms with volatile stock prices

in the case of viking their stock price saw a huge bump  of 10 when they announced very positive results for the oral version of their drug which is still in phase 1 currently an analyst expressed skepticism over their ability to eventually produce the drug at scale due to high costs and expertise requirements so the investigation that opened is looking into whether they adequately disclosed production capabilities since the stock price and perceived value of the firm went up 

not very concerning and pretty much par for the course with these type of companies drug is in phase i so a long way from market their subcutaneous injection version is further along in clinical trials having recently concluded phase ii and will be a bigger catalyst for them in the nearer term also sellside analysts are notoriously horrible at evaluating smaller biopharma firms  technically lucid had some of the richest backers the saudis they own nearly half of the damn company now  true but like 125 of rivian is also owned by some saudi guy honestly if rivian didnt burn so much cash i would perfer them to lucid  i really want to get a lucid

Tesla CEO Elon Musk loses bid to get $56 billion pay package reinstated,"a delaware judge ruled on monday that tesla ceo elon musk still is not entitled to receive a 56 billion compensation package despite shareholders of the electric vehicle company voting to reinstate itthe ruling by the judge chancellor kathaleen mccormick of the court of chancery follows her january decision that called the pay package excessive and rescinded it surprising investors and cast uncertainty over musks future at the worlds most valuable carmaker

tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent june vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for musk the companys driving force who is responsible for many of its advances and reinstate his compensationmccormick also ordered tesla to pay the attorneys who brought the case 345 million well short of the billions they initially requested

httpscourtsdelawaregovopinionsdownloadaspxid372420  345 million to the lawyers who brought the lawsuit is absolutely insane  why is everyone in here acting like this vote was their choice when retail investors hold like 40 stake in tesla lmao  if the company was privately owned musk could choose to pay himself any amount

because he took his company public and sold shares of it to the public it now falls under the purview of the legal system  he can work with the court to get paid but the court now has a say in how things are done  the legal system can hold companies accountable even if their stock holders would rather they not  

if musk repurchase the outstanding shares he can make tesla private  56b is well over a billion a week which works out to 25m per hour i agree with the judge a bit excessive at 7k per second  how is a judge being able to block shareholder decisions like this  itt all the troll farms from the election reactivated to try to get elon a payout after illegally colluding with the board of directors  how can a judge decide whats excessive but then decide that awarding the attorneys 345 million isnt  seems excessive to me  full disclaimer not an elon fan boy youre welcome to browse my history 

this decision first and now second time is beyond asinine 

when this compensation package was voted in it was a literal laughing stock of an idea you can still youtube the cnbc clips 

the targets were so far out of the money it was an absolute slam dunk for the shareholders  there was no one except for elon that thought this was a good idea 

so to then revise this because elon managed to hit these absolutely ridiculous targets is absolutely absurd and incorrect 

i completely disagree with these decisions  the shocking thing for me is that the courts are taking this action but it seems elon can get away with massive stock price manipulation through his hugely misleading public statements for years  the myth of consensual compensation

elon i consent

shareholders i consent

judge i dont 

is there somebody you forgot to ask  removed  idiots trying to cover his 44b losses from buying and ruining twitter  i hate musk as much as the next guy but how can a judge overrule what owners of a company pays their ceo

the shareholders collectively agreed via a vote to approve the compensation package how can any judge overrule this what law is being broken here i am honestly confused  the ruling raises serious questions about shareholder rights if a majority of shareholders voted to approve a pay package how can a judge nullify that decision it feels like a dangerous precedent where courts can override the will of the owners undermining the very essence of public companies shouldnt the shareholders have the final say in how their company is run  the judge thinks the pay package is excessive yet then awards attorneys over 300 million the fuck lol  lol vote passed overwhelmingly twice but judge says nah lol

we gotta vote again it seems  question to shareholders that voted in favor of passing this package 

why  that a judge can call a pay package excessive and nullify it on those grounds after the initial problems were fixed with a 2nd shareholder vote is actually scary   this is why we nees regulation  the judge made the right decision  the happy ending hope this shit is done for good  ceos literally running companies into the ground and getting billion dollar parachutes and a direct referral to a c suite position at another company and the us court system is going after a man who manufactures the most successful electric vehicles on the market runs a rocket company that dickslaps nasa incompetency in the face and people in this thread are really going to argue this decision isnt anything but ugly malice from a personally or politically driven individual unworthy of her position

regardless of your sentiments of musk as a personality he has not only grown tesla into a behemoth electric car manufacturer hes done more to catapult the us as a nation forward technologically than very few individuals in history the federal government should be kissing his feet with the contribution he has made to this country far more value than this pathetic judge or the representatives in congress with a chip on their shoulder about him  so many people in the comments are so full of jealousy and hatred this verdict to overrule a 72 majority vote from shareholders stinks of corruption andor major bias if you think anything about this is fair i worry about you  i voted no on this fuck that what a waste of money  good i voted no hes got enough money use the money to buy back tesla shares and help raise the price to 400  dont worry he has a job that keep him busy at least next 4yrs or the minute he get bored of getting rid of goverment department  thats fine   dont gimme that  what if you earned 56k  a judge took it away fk  leon  so sad anyway  keep in mind shareholders who didnt vote all thier votes are counted as for elon  this ruling against elon musks 56 billion pay package could be a wakeup call for corporate governance and executive compensation practices

imo this is a reminder that no one not even a visionary ceo is above scrutiny it also highlights a growing concern over the gap between executive pay and company performance

it risks alienating musk whose vision and leadership are central to tesla any uncertainty about his future involvement could spook investors but the good the decision could push tesla to adopt a more balanced compensation structure reassuring critics and promoting better governance    his house is made of straw  i hope musk follows through on his threat to move to other companies spoiler alert he wont  i guess the next move will be to reincorporate in texas  startups wont automatically incorporate in delaware after a ruling like this delaware is the one that will be losing long term it will be too risky to do business in that environment where judges can go rogue  repeat after me tesla is a tech company not a carmaker  good  hahaha  nice well deserved  arent there limit for managerial remuneration i can see it in billions but it must be within certain limits  good  i hate musk as much as the next guy and its definitely excessive but its insane that a judge can just make a ruling on a company even against the shareholders votes 

people keep saying stuff about the law does anyone know which specific laws prevent a public company from paying an executive an excessive amount obviously if it was private it wouldnt matter  lmao de_stroyed fuck him  a corporations board is supposed to be independent advocate for the shareholders and provide oversight of the ceo  in this case tesla has  elon and his brother and elon stans as the board   hard to argue they are acting in the interest of the companyshareholders awarding 56b to the ceo  they could do a massive stock buyback and give elon and everyone else a payday with that 56b  it just wouldnt be wildly obscene just obscene  i think the whole thing is dumb judge shouldnt overreach but i also think musk is overboardgreedy the company  share holdwr got him super rich to where next 10 or 100 generation would be well off he should focus on taking care of the com0amyshare holders not try to greedily take as much as he can threats demand etc  crazy to see people supporting this when its textbook weaponization of the justice system  leon held a gun to tsla shareholders heads to get them to vote yes back in june whatever will he do now with his new political power  i always wonder why pay package is used as the press wording compensation package in the form of stock options sound way less misleading in this case  this judge needs to be investigated ill start by saying if i was a shareholder of tesla i would have voted hell no to this compensation as i dont think its even close to in the benefit of the shareholders however the shareholders voted two times to approve this pay package the fact that a judge can overrule the owners of a company for how much they want to pay its ceo is absolutely absurd and should be immediately appealed  where were the judges when im holding jcp bonds and the executive board paid themselves out millions as the company went bankrupt we didnt get to vote on it either  lmao good jobwhile hes paying his staff rubbish wages and union busting he doesnt deserve anything close to thisall he does is snort ket and tweet anyway  say what you will but at the time the price targets of the pay package were absurd i despise musk but he managed to hit those all of those milestones i think they should pay him every penny  its 1 thing to deny elon the pay package which he deserves its another thing to award the lawyers 345 million  justice served to someone finally  i am tired of these arrogant manipulative fraudulent people getting away with things  may elon and tesla fail or get taken over by someone more ethical  very interesting thanks for linking i spent more time than i expected to reading through it  that is so high is just sounds like a made up number people actually make that much like wtf  well short of the billions they originally sought   a huge part of the decision goes into how they settled on this number based on the way fees are normally allocated for cases like this 345m is actually very low and so most of that text is spent explaining howwhy it was being lowered  
   
its probably worth keeping in mind that this is 03 of the sum that hangs in the balance here the pay package effectively grants 100b to elon the stakes are big when its a shitload of money on the line  didnt he win retail investors i thought it was like the big institutional guys like pension funds and hedge funds that voted against  hes skipping around like a dipshit  because thats how stock market works you want more say own more sharesnot  to mention retail voted overwhelmingly for the package so your point makes no sense  funding secured  pretty reductive

by that logic no public company can ever have its shareholders decide on anything look i despise elon musk and i think the pay package is obscene but an overwhelming majority of shareholders supported the pay package if 72 of shareholders yes that was the actual percentage want to be idiotic and donate their equity to elon musk i dont see how a judge can stop them i see this as judicial overreach

tesla might be a public company but at the end of the day this is a private matter between tesla and its shareholders it seems the shareholders are happy

btw i was against the pay package before the june vote because i didnt think it was fair that teslas current shareholders be bound to something the 2018 shareholders approved but they approved it overwhelmingly in june 2024 so i dont see the issue  a private company doesnt fall under the purview of the legal system 

the court now has a say in how things are done

1 all corporations fall under the purview of the legal system 

2 a court always has a say in how things are done as it concerns legally binding contracts shareholder rights etc

3 people in private companies sue each other all the time  if the shareholders vote for something how does the court overrule it

isnt the shareholders voting over 50 already why do their votes not count

mostly just curious because this seems wild to me  yes now do boeing intel att and all the rest of them  why would you think that privately held companies are immune to litigation   since almost all his wealth is because of his tesla shares i dont see how that could be a viable solution for him  now that hes suddenly buddy buddy with trump im sure he will try to weasle his way around the ruling  that doesnt sound right the only legal requirements that really change are the ones about accountability reporting and transparency there is no sudden cap on executive benefits because a company is public if there was shouldnt his board have already denied the request  this will go to the supreme court which is repub favoured and will be shut down  well said  most the board members are related somehow they hold millions of shares between them almost more than whats outstanding also the compensation package is for shares of tesla at a undervalued price  can also go to scotus which would resolve this considering his bff is the new president i doubt this issue sticks long  musk was not one of the founders of tesla  it is not his company   he bought a majority of ownership shares in 2004  he became ceo in 2008    deleted  regardless of your theory of ownership this wont pass supreme court muster as it interferes with a legal decision about how to invest a corporations money in a legal pursuit  it is in effect a taking 

what is the limiting or controlling rule what dollar amount is too much to pay a ceo  no judges cant make arbitrary decisions from the bench this is way over the line and its obvious this is one of those wack job liberal judges who just doesnt like the guy  thatss approximately half of teslas profit since its inception  damn an extra 7k a year would be gamechanging for me  wrong thats for 1 year

this pay package is from 2018present so 7 years  the amount is irrelevant the deal was for him to get paid in a certain amount of stock  we wouldnt be having this discussion if the stock was 50  but this pay package isnt salary or cash its stock options ie increased ownership of tesla

musk gets 0 salary from his position as ceo   well when you take a 100m company and turn it into a 1t company how much of that growth do you deserve  since hed get nothing without achieving what people called impossible the real worth was pimpossible56b


this was an extremely good deal for the shareholders since even if they had to pay achieving the impossible would have made them a filthy net profit


that was the opinion of everyone at the time even the musk haters just ridiculed his delusions that a judge can decide otherwise by taking the impossible achievement for granted is blatantly corrupt   jesus christ it would be like an irl tycoon game wtf  how much isnt the issue it shouldnt matter  you cant arbitrarily decide when to make these rulings based on some amount or wealth of the person  deleted  a shareholder vote doesnt supercede the law

the original package was rescinded you cant overrule a court decision with a shareholder vote

they could have voted for a new package but because musk didnt want to get reamed on the taxes that would involve he tried to push through a reinstatement of the original package  like all things this is far more complicated than redditors are appreciating and youre not going to understand it if you only read headlines there is a legitimate legal issue with how the original pay package was established which is to say it was done fraudulently of course a judge can stop a company from doing something that is fraudulent even if its shareholders think its ok  because theres laws to protect stupid people from their stupid decisions for their own good  its minority shareholder rights if you own 51 of a company and vote to write yourself an unreasonably large check for no reason the other 49 needs recourse  because theres protection in place to prevent majority shareholders from screwing the minority shareholders and these ideas go all the way back to the beginning of the 20th century where the courts ruled that henry ford wasnt allowed to screw the dodge brothers elon musk should have known the rules of the game before he started playing the board and majority shareholders need to stop these ridiculous compensation packages that are diluting minority holders beyond reason  i take my company public with a float of 49 i still own 51 i own half the board seats and a quarter are my buddies we send it for a vote on whether i can get paid 100x the going rate for a salary of a ceo for a company my size aka pseudo embezzle any profits to avoid paying shareholders i vote 51 and maybe 20 of the other people actually proxy vote so it gets passed by a landslide 
judge calls shenanigans 
oversimplified but scenarios like that  the judge ruled in favor of the initial plaintiffs  who sued claiming that the compensation was excessive and against their interests as shareholders   today they ruled that the attempt to create facts after the matter had been ruled against teslas board of directors and musk was a violation existing rules and precedents  tesla is publicly traded and granting an exorbitant pay package is not in line with a company taking its fiduciary duty to investors seriously  they wont be able to for long trump admin about to make this judge disappear  some shareholders sued to overturn the original board decision the shareholders voters approved 

the shareholders who sued sued on the basis that the deal the board wasnt in the best interest of the company the deal was overturned for breaking the law is massachusetts  

musk moved teslas corporate office to texas and had a vote to say tesla shareholders think the original deal should be reinstated 

the judge has said a shareholder vote cant over turn the law and tesla must pay the lawyer fees

musk could now bring a new vote with a whole new payment package but that would have to be voted on separately from the previously voted on package  dont worry its fine to step over the boundaries of the law if its against someone the internet doesnt like  why is elon so selfish that he needs another 56 billion dollars  more than the company has ever made  the 56 billion is better invested in the company than giving it to elon  deleted  the lawyers made the mistake of asking for billions in compensation rather than trillions  345 million to the lawyers is fucking insane  theres a giant space between those two figures one is 56 billion more  how can a judge judge you mean  dudeexactly   this whole thing is insane

one party hit the impossible kpis and growth promises

the people who have their capital on the line agree that a capital investment into their unicorn ceo is a good idea

yet two seperate parties who have spent their life making arguably negative contributions to society get huge pay days to the benefit ofno one  this will set precedent that 1 shareholder can sue to veto any corporate vote in the future with the incentive that they could win a big payout its going to result in a lot of companies leaving delaware because shareholders will not want their votes to be vetoed by a judge who has no stake in the company they will also not want a bunch of lawsuits representing 1 shareholder which is completely absurd  56 billion is roughly 56 billion more than 345 million  the weird thing is its stock options compensation and not cash compensation as its always suggested by the term pay package so i bet if tesla hadnt increased so much in value this deal would have never been disputed  elon would be making over a billion or week that works out to over 7k per second for a 40 hour work week what do you think about that excessive   the targets were so far out of the money

you mean the public targets presented to the shareholders

remind me of what the board was saying privately again  the initial pay package was done illegally 

the shareholder vote doesnt change the fact that it was still illegal it was more of the shareholders acknowledging that the original pay package was illegal but they agree to it

but it doesnt take away that it was still illegal in the first place they will need to go back and draw up a new pay package  you can disagree that doesnt change anything about the laws that apply and that are to be followed elon musk doesnt get a pass to do whatever he wants anymore than anybody else

so as an investor you should support those decisions even if you disagree with the outcome because investors rely on the rule of law to prevail  exactly elon took an insanely risky bet then mega delivered and now people are rewriting history to claim the board was deceived this is such a waste of time a lawyer fees  its pretty hilarious for you to be so smarmy and definitive when youve clearly not read anything except for headlines and maybe watched a cnbc clip theres a legitimate legal issue as it relates to the origination of the pay package and how it was approved this isnt about hitting targets or denying this package because a judge thinks the total number is too high like literally not even close to what the issue is here your comment is extremely naive and your tone makes it embarrassing  well unfortunately for you the law disagrees whoops  pure emotional damage  musk threads hit so fucking good now  removed  they can agree to a new package but not reinstate the old package main difference is taxation  didnt he musk taint the vote threatening to quit and take part of teslas business with him all to convince people to approve a ridiculous pay package that was negotiated in bad faith basically saying he will tank the company unless he gets his way  because its a rigged voting
if you didnt vote at all they are all counted as yes for the pay package  have you read anything beyond the headline if youre genuinely confused im sure youve sought some actual information  standard is 10 which would have been much more  cut down from the billions originally proposed  a shareholder vote doesnt overrule rule the law  deleted  didnt musk taint the vote by threatened to leave the company and not develop ai products through tesla he basically would tank the company unless he gets a ridiculous pay package negotiated in bad faith its not surprising the shareholders wouldnt want that  please learn a thing or two about law  vote all they want these vote holds as much weight as twitter votes people dont get to ignore the law just because of theres a vote  

heres another example

person a agrees to be killed by person b 

person b killed person a

state will charge person b of murder regardless if they voted for it or signed an agreement   because love him or hate him elon has a track record for making a lot of money for investors and tesla investors want him at the helm and committed to pushing innovation at tesla  it takes a special kind of person to invest in an automotive company trading at 98x earnings that barely grew revenue this year while most other companies in the same industry are trading at 35x earnings  the initial problems werent really fixed and it wouldnt matter if they were the original package was rescinded you cant ratify it with a shareholder vote to try and bypass a court ruling

if they created a new package and fixed all the issues that caused the original to be rescinded then they could have potentially pushed it through a vote but they stupidly tried to ratify an already rescinded package

the only scary thing here is that people think a shareholder vote can let you bypass a court ruling lol  initial problems werent fixed

shareholder vote was pretty much shareholders voting to acknowledge the original pay package was illegal

doesnt change the original pay package was still illegal  those arent the grounds like at all not even close and the issues of the first vote werent fixed like at all not even close 

how are so many of you so confident on this but seemingly havent read a single thing the judge has written  its really crazy to be honest i voted against the package because imo its insane but i think democracy should prevail and if the shareholders voted for it thats what should happen its crazy that a judge can subjectively define whats excessive and nullify a legit vote made by the shareholders  the ruling is on the initial package you cannot mend evidence this way and present it to the court hoping for a different outcome   after the initial problems were fixed 

wasnt the basis of this that nothing changed other than a shareholder vote where the shareholders were lied to  as noted in the judges ruling precedent and established rules of the court dont allow companies to use this as a workaround to a judges ruling  the plaintiffs large shareholders argued the compensation was outrageous the court agreed  then tesla tried to go back and do an end run around that finding by creating more facts that were not in evidence after the issue had been ruled against tesla  if companies could do this then cases would never end because companies would just keep going back and adding more of this kind of evidence   
it isnt actually scary at all  unless you are also the ceo of a corporation with a compensation package that has not been properly reviewed  its not they just have to redo the paperwork   hey get out of here with your reasonable take saying elon bad is the only way to get guaranteed upvotes over here  yeah its always great when a judge overrules a supermajority of shareholders because they have a personal grudge against a ceo  thats usually how shareholder votes work lol  yes its called lying to shareholders about projections telling them one thing then saying something else internally this invalidated the original package

there is nothing stopping them from creating a new package and paying him a trillion dollars but it needs to be a new package not the one that was already deemed illegal  the requirement to unlock his pay package was to raise the market value of the company from 50 billion to 650 billion he did that lmfao  they didnt follow due process and theyve tried to spurn the court at every turn a shareholder vote cant undo a court ruling lol  judge is doing a service to shareholders and you want to take away people that protect shareholders  ah yes the company that single handedly started the ev revolution should fail so smart  and then you realize its less than 1 of the total amount musk would have been paid a billion dollars is so unfathomable much less 50  i should have become a lawyer  mccormick found that the 56 billion fee request by the shareholders attorneys which at one time approached 7 billion based on teslas trading price went too far

in a case about excessive compensation that was a bold ask mccormick wrote  the two largest institutional investors vanguard and blackrock voted yeshttpsclsblueskylawcolumbiaedu20240701howteslapumpedthevote but many others voted no retail investors largely voted yes which isnt surprising  the boards recommendation was to approve it most institutional guys like vanguard and fidelity go with the recommendation along with anyone retail who doesnt vote goes with the recommendation  at 42069 per share  aight you know how it went lol  i dont get all the details so id love to have it explained where im wrong but i believe the issue is the judge is saying this pay package cannot be approved because the pay package originates from fraudulent situations in disclosures  board makeup they need to make a new pay package and vote on it not try the same one repeatedly which he doesnt want to do as it exposes him to higher taxes 

thats my limited incorrect understanding  well in fairness large decisions  like a 56bn payout  are indeed decided by shareholders  youre mischaracterizing what this lawsuit is about it was initiated by tesla shareholders who argue that even though musk only owns 20 of tesla the entire board is beholden to him and failed to properly negotiate his compensation as well as misrepresented facts to shareholders before letting them vote on the package

the latter claim is the root of the issue  no

board members have a fiduciary duty to the shareholders these board members had conflicts of interest and violated their duties

further musk lied to shareholders in the proxy statement leading up to the first vote

all of that made the foundation of the compensation package fraudulent

here we had another vote doesnt mean they

 cured the issues with the bod conflicts of interest

 fixed the proxy statements

they didnt do either they just held another vote

that doesnt override the fraud and failed fiduciary duties  the payout was predicated on the shareholders getting a much larger return compared to musks compensation

not really foolish since musk is likely the most influential ceo on stock price if he died tomorrow tesla shares would sink  shareholders arent god  they cannot for example vote to give 100 of shares outstanding to elon musk in return for dogecoinx

very broadly speaking contract law has minimum standards in place to stop people from being contractually idiotic  undue influence can render a contract void for example

no matter before a court is ever truly private  the mere fact that it is before a court is evidence that the private agreement was not adequate to settle all claims  this seems like its overreach because when talked about the situation is boiled down too far for accurate depiction 

the shareholders have never actually directly approved a 56b pay package they have approved the board deciding to award the pay package which the judge has already ruled the board could not do because of how it was all presented 

the vote was just should we approve what a judge already ruled illegal which you obviously cant do 

tesla could just bring up the question of the approval directly from shareholders but im guessing its not simple for one reason or another which is why they avoided it in the vote  dont break the law and you wont have to deal with the repercussions 

or take the company private and there wont be any of this mess  any idea what laws or case precedent the court is relying on  yeah i gotta agree here 

the shareholders voted for it    

i dont agree with it but its not up to me it should be up to the shareholders  assuming the court has a valid legal basis to make the determination i think a court should decide that 11600000 per hour is excessive pay the court has a duty to all shareholders including the 28 that voted no or any that abstained from voting

 assumed he worked 10 hours a week for 50 weeks on tesla given he also runs several other large companies  so lets say for the sake of argument that my friends and i own 51 of the voting shares of a public company we can now vote to give ourselves an extra 100 million shares and dilute the remaining 49 of shareholders into oblivion  ceo says if i achieve the impossible and make you filthy rich i get a cut and if i dont i get nothing


you seriously claim this is a bad deal for the shareholders absolutely no one thought that at the time   i dont understand how denying him the package is even up for debate  wasnt it a deal he made with the company many years ago that they agreed to if he met certain milestones  then he met them all and they decided to not give it to him  how is that legal  based on what ive learned in this thread the tsla shareholders should unite and vote against the laws of thermodynamics next

why should any judge or physicist tell them what do with their own company  this particular shareholder vote in this particular jurisdiction doesnt turn an invalid pay package into a valid one in fact its not possible for any shareholder vote to ratify a pay package that was judged to be illegal  this pay structure is what motivated musk to get tesla to where it is 

he set an impossible goal for production rate and sales and stock price and then hit those far flung goals  he deserves to be compensated for success  no one said they didnt but there is additional oversight for public companies that op clearly laid out simple concept to grasp go be cleverly contrarian somewhere else maybe rteenagers  the board all abstained the package was approved by outside shareholders only  they are also making the company to texas which makes it mostly moot because while the case can be tried in texas again the governor of texas is trying to make texas instead of delaware the hub for these things precisely on the grounds that texas courts wont try this so the outcome will be pretty predictable  i dont think it will get out of deleware 

the state is heavily funded by corporations and they will leave over this i dont think they want to be bound by a supreme court ruling and will settle this in a way they control  if thats not how it works please do explain how it does work instead of just saying no youre wrong  no that is literally how it works and just did work lol 

if you want to be a public corporation and enjoy the benefits offered by the state in doing so you have to abide by corporate law  true for most of us i think if you lined 4 currency counter machines side by side and loaded them up with hundred dollar bills and they each count 1000 bills per minute for 40 hours it still will fall well short of what em is being offered per week  excessive you be the judge  upgrade your skills and do it  he owns like 13 of tesla shares so you can make the argument he already got his due from that growth  i think the people who actually took it there the employees deserve a huge percentage of that  if you do that alone then you deserve a lot

if youre the ceo of 4 other companies one of the best diablo players in the world a fake government official and constantly posting on twitter at all hours then chances are you dont deserve 25mhr because youre being carried by your employees  those are paper gains though  musk is very familiar with lawfare as he has been suing everyone using the same 1 judge from texas who is a tesla shareholder

httpswwwnprorg20240809gs116087elonmusklawsuitstexassamejudgehearsthemteslastock

lets stop clutching our pearls over that overpaid disgrace of a human being who keeps circumventing laws and manipulating his owns stock and elections  the fact that youre even using the word lawfare on what are fairly fundamental corporate law principles that have been around for over a century says it all  dont equate the law with what is right  at times it is flat out wrong  is this 56 billion currently reflected in his ownership  ie pay was issued and will be taken away from him or is it the case that if he won on appeal hed be given 56 billion in additional stock  seems like all you really need is vector and a projectile  deleted  how come theres no such law for presidential election   no because theres laws protecting minority shareholders from the majority  so someone owns 9 shares of tesla get to tell 90 shareholders how they should vote listen to what you wrote besides you being butt hurt about elon getting paid name another company you invest in that you think this rule should apply  we voted for the pay package twice second time with all the info the judge thought we were mislead to go without this is simply lawfare  which doesnt apply here  btw these laws shouldnt exist in a free country  did most of the remaining 49 vote in favour of not paying him the package  the difference is the votes came from normal shareholders and the compensation was fair considering everyone thought the goals were nearly impossible  and the 56 billion pay bracket is more than what the company is worth its more than the sum of all the profits tesla ever made
giving musk 56 billion would destroy the value of the company and leave it with massive debt
destroying the company is not good for share holders and thus the judge understands what a 56 billion pay out would do to the company

but the fact that it was than approved by share holders is also obsured  what defines exorbitant when the package was approved it was not worth 56 billion dollars  


this pay is representing an unrealistic moonshot stretch goal that elon nailed  shareholders approved this and now that he reached the goal they take it back 


extremely unethical and at the core negligent towards fiduciary duty  you do realize theyre  not just giving him 46 billion dollars hes just getting shares in the company which are created out of thin air  the original verdict was well before the election and musks appointment to a fake committee  exactlyseems arbitrary and anchored to an original number  i think you missed his point lol  the board was projecting 2 different scenarios

publicly they stated that these numbers were almost impossible to hit

privately they projected the numbers were well within reach

they also convinced shareholders that the pay package was vetted by an independent party which was not true the board is full of elon loyalist not tesla loyalists  no they wont leave the delaware court of chancery is extremely convenient for corporations and shareholders you have a better chance at vc funding being incorporated there  good things most lawyers will be smart enough to understand why there are rules for public companies  how does that make 345 million not excessive  the 56 billion was a number voted on twice by the companies shareholders with tangible performance metrics that were exceeded  yes thats excessive too but its what the shareholders voted for and he delivered on the results  no idea what was the board saying  illegal they projected the growth everyone but elon deemed it impossible and the shareholders approved its that simple there was nothing illegal about it  illegal in this lone judges opinion

lets see what judges in higher courts decide upon appeal  layers of absurd and needless paperwork bureaucracy and middlemen this is what the shareholders want the government needs to get the hell out of the way and let people do stuff again   and now people are rewriting history to claim the board was deceived

i dont know who people are but thats not at all the argument being made by the judge the argument being made is that the board misled shareholders by implying that the milestones needed to hit each tranche were more difficult than the company had calculated internally it is illegal for the board of a company to mislead its shareholders  removed  removed  removed  can u explain the taxation bit  i dont know but even if he did thats him threatening to take his skills elsewhere if he doesnt get the compensation he wants

dont we all do that with our employers  do you have a source for that that isnt generally how proxy votes work

they need a majority of yes votes  her logic was we the shareholders were misinformed we then got that info already had the performance gains of the stock and still voted for the pay package we proved her analysis incorrect is the point shes just using her position to hurt musk which is something i hope tesla investors legally go after her for  so what even are the consequences of this  it does not say that anywhere   so wtf is the point of this whole thing we voted twice passed she said fuck us twice but tesla will still give him the 56 billion hows that work  i feel like if what you said were true then cnbc etc wouldnt be making such a big deal about this  the judge did not state that anywhere in the ruling  or does he just have a track record of getting lucky and being in the right place at the right time  choose any competitors stock and compare it to tsla in the 1 month 6 month ytd 1year 2year and 5year charts 

  
im willing to bet that most fordvolkswagenetc investors wished they had bought tesla stock instead  reading these morons try to understand corporate law is painful how can they be so easy to manipulate  her logic was that missing info could have changed the vote we the shareholders told her she is wrong with a second vote shes ignoring that she was proven wrong to maintain her ruling which can only be interpreted as an attack on musk or an enrichment of the prosecuting lawyers either way she should be investigated  it was a new pay package though 
instead of here are the hoops it was should we compensate him this amount retroactively 

its an entirely different type of proposal   it wasnt nullified for being excessive it was determined that the tsla independent board was not in fact independent

regardless of if shareholders voted on it the pay package is tainted 

theres no way to know if the board at the time truly negotiated the best deal in the interest of the shareholders   thats not what the judge did though guys can you please read the case before posting inflammatory comments  what makes things even worse is that this is about retroactive compensation he did all the things he said he was going to do which outsiders called crazy and now hes getting screwed for making people including many people in dc very very rich   but then wouldnt the second pay package still stand and they just have to pay the 345m  supermajority cant overrule rule of law what if supermajority of pfizer shareholders voted to illegally sell water as vaccinesshould that overrule the law because the supermajority agrees to it  and thats why it doesnt mean much  it is never a service to shareholders to overrule their decision twice if shareholders wanted to donate all of their profits to charity or burn them in a dumpster fire the only ethical thing is to let them do so a judge is not supposed to have the say on what benefits them the most and theoretically a judge could make a decision that results in financial damage to shareholders with no liability for the outcome

that said this is now the legal precedent in delaware if you buy shares in a delaware company your decisions may always be vetoed by a judge now buyer beware  the shareholders voted in favor of it two times actually the judge overstepped  how is crashing a companys stock a service to shareholders

you are all now poor your welcome  oh please elon started nothing  isnt that shit wild throwing around numbers that basically dont even exist its just so fuckin big  56  yep 03  i wont say billionaires shouldnt exist but nobody should be paid in billions i know it wasnt cash its obscene  most blatant case of stock manipulation that went unpunished   nice  i sold 100 000 shares of tesla a few weeks after the sec stepped in about that tweet 

biggest regret of my life  always about taxes  pretty much the most simple description its what these tesla shareholders arent getting

you just cant keep submitting an illegal pay package  but the package wasnt illegal so much as the lack of disclosures around it the original ruling which i agree with 

if thats the case then why would you not be able to make the proper disclosures and revote on it 

does this judge think she can define what is an appropriate package because that would be absolute judicial over reach 

and i dont like his pay package but i also dont want judges to determine ceo pay  the claim was that it was not sufficiently disclosed there was nothing unlawful about the vote the board members all abstained from their votes to create a real majority of the minority vote

this literally cannot stand without destroying delware as a corporate haven it wont survive deleware review the feds will eviserate it  the shareholder that initiated the lawsuit owns like 10 tesla shares

there was a revote and the shareholders again voted highly in favor of the pay package  shareholder with a grand total of 9 shares not shareholders and they get 345mn when they created zero wealth for the stakeholders this is beyond ridiculous  precisely what did they misrepresent

the only tangible argument was that the board of directors was not completely impartial and had ties to elon musk this however does not invalidate the fact that shareholders voted to award elon musk this pay package should tesla shareholders hit certain roi targets  twice  once in 2018 and again in 2024

the 2024 results are interesting because while shareholders approved elon musks pay package they also scaled up shareholder control by passing proposals that shortened board terms  despite the board advising them to vote against these proposals

this shows that the shareholders are aware of the issues with the boards ties to elon musk but that doesnt make them feel differently about whether or not elon musk should receive his ceo bonus

i dont know what to say but the boards ties to elon musk is an issue sure it becomes less of an issue though when the terms are voted on by the shareholders directly which happened both times  they actually can the standard is disclosure only when disclosure fails do we go to a fairness rule as long as all the conflicted voters are abstained it could happen under a majority of the minority vote  what law did he break  she says in her original ruling the case is novel thats legal speak for we have never done anything like this before  laws are there to protect the shareholders  who got to place the shareholders  they didnt disclose the pay package which is the part thats the problem 

they need to make a new pay package that is disclosed and then vote on it  what a ridiculous thing to say

thats not whats happening here at all

you and your friends wouldnt be able to do that because you dont actually work at the company elon musk was awarded these shares due to his time as teslas ceo its basically a bonus in stock options

its also performance tied

not only do you need to be the ceo but you need to have achieved specific rois for all shareholders to unlock the ceo bonus at the end of the term

this ceo bonus will also need to be agreed upon beforehand you cant arbitrarily decide to hand it out

this bonus was agreed upon in 2017 and hinged on the performance  of teslas stock between 2018 and 2024

and really elon musk getting 56 billion in stock wont inflate away the value of the company as thats about 34 of the companys market cap

so yea sure

1 get your friends to buy 51 in a public company
2 appoint yourself as ceo for 6 years
3 negotiate a bonus payment with all shareholders where you get an extra 5 of the companys after 6 years if you double everyones capital
4 hope you actually pull through

and for reference while tesla stock holders can expect to be diluted by 5 because of elon musks bonus they did make 1600 roi in those 6 years

so yea i guess to some degree there is an argument where elon musk has earned this bonus as its only a tiny fraction of what investors made tesla after all is special in that no other company has a ceo that is so central to its mythos  its not a private company shareholders matter the board members have a fiduciary responsibility to protect them from mismanagementlike an excessive pay package  there is additional oversight for public companies but the relevant oversight in this case also applies to private companies if tesla was private it would still have shareholders and a board of directors with a fiduciary responsibility to those shareholders if tesla was private and gave musk this payout then one of its private shareholders could still sue and say the compensation agreement was invalid because the board failed to act appropriately  he wont his bio is literally if i block you its because i dont see a point in arguing with people who dont know what theyre talking about

its just a 12 year old trolling  unfortunately chose my job out of passion and not for the salary  what skill do i upgrade thats worth 7k per second  that is completely separate thing shareholders gets paid by owning the shares  no work required all shareholders benefit when company grows  no need to do any work  
ceos doesnt work for the shares they already have  they can earn money on them even if they dont work as ceos they work for money either in dollars or in stock or options  
he made one of the most spectacular return on investment ever  turning company that was worth less than 1b into company that is worth more than one trillion any shareholder at any company worth less than a billion would pay ceo 56 billion to 1000x their investment into trillion  yeah and so does vanguard yet they arent running the company are they  nobody does anything alone so this is a meaningless differentiation i couldnt care less about musks comp but this is definitely a reddit take you cant even make a big mac on your own so to try to differentiate a ceo that does it alone vs is carried is hilarious and is obviously politically motivated by you here the entire job of the c suite is to manage the workforce essentially obviously theyre not doing anything alone  well i dont think you understand role of ceo  
it isnt to work 60 hours a week and to create amazing things  
their work is to arrange things so that company grows and grow fast and profitably mostly by being carried by their talented employees  
yet only three or four companies managed to be carried by their employees to one trillion valuation  
no one pays ceo by hours worked and no one cares how many hours they work as long as shareholders make nice money  it should not be included in his ownership   the shares still exist in an account if thats what you mean but its not part of his net worth  the original package was approved by a biased board so a shareholder sued on the grounds that the board violated their duty to shareholders  because the people on the board of directors who approved the pay package are conflicted and are associates of musk and did not properly insulate themselves from the obvious conflict of interest in approving the largest pay package in the history of the world by a long shot lot including people like his own brother

maybe you should actually read about the case or any of the basic facts before you form an opinion that its stupid lol 

literally asking why they did it and calling it stupid in the same comment talk about stupid  because thats exactly what corporate courts are for to ensure that investors arent taken advantage of

you cant have a shareholder vote to overrule the law lol  when youre a publicly traded company you have a fiduciary duty to the shareholders to act in their best interest  they didnt do that here  because we have laws to protect investors why allow a board and ceo to take advantage of investors   why is a court telling companies how to run their business 

bro what you do know there are laws in this country right  that was one of the original purpose of the electoral college xd

ofc in practice it never actually functioned that way  even felons can be presidents so not surprised  there is  the electoral college is that

its just that the smart people arent the politicians like it should be theyre the people behind them buying politicians out and rigging the system  thats exactly why they came up with the electoral college  because one party works hard to ensure there are no such laws  i dont know how it is in america but here in europe where the judges are corrupt you can just get your opponent convicted and thatll be all it shouldnt be that way and thats one of the reasons it isnt 

mandela was in prison for decades before becoming president i am not saying this is the same i am just saying that it is democratic  its a feature not a bug  that would be called selling your equity stake in an open and free market  nobody is being held by gunpoint to hold shares of tsla  no the judge stated that you must draw up a restructured pay package because the first one was illegally done 

shareholders rights dont supercede the law  if you read the decision it wasnt just the disclosure of conflicts they had problems with it was the boards process for negotiating it  resubmitting the package from the old process shows that they didnt remedy that part  elon doesnt own anywhere close to 50 of tesla 

but the pay package passed with 72 support  it was 90 for the plan it went to 75 with the entire board and musk abstaining from the second round  whatever metrics you use the company is worth significantly more than that regardless if you think the company is worth that little then this pay package is also worth way less his pay package is just a percentage of the company  their internal projections prior to the first vote had it at a 60 chance of him hitting all the goals that does seem pretty unethical and negligent to not share that with shareholders and instead sell it as an impossible task that would never happen when those are pretty decent odds  seriously lol reddit is so dumb  but then after all of that became public knowledge the shareholders voted to reinstate it they essentially said we dont care so why does the judge have the ability to dictate against the free will of a public companys shareholders

i do not own tsla stock or have any positions relating to it  what do you mean

they made capital contributors aware that this package would only get paid out if a likely impossible objective was achieved shoot for the stars champ  regardless of the outcome the shareholders benefited because the company would be miles ahead of where it was

internally theyre sending a message to the troops that although this seems impossible its not  we can do it if we execute perfectly

you cant achieve anything of value without sending that second message internally   they had to have projections that it was possible or theyd be criminals to event attempt it

please for the love of god use your brain and think   theres so many other companies that are blatantly corrupt on wall street  you dont even have to try to make the argument and you can be the czar of wisdom

why steel man a side that has no rationality in being correct   is this even your idea or something thats slowly been bled into your consciousness from micro interactions with media  if x is excessive and y is roughly x less than x x can be excessive without y being excessive  the tesla board never told shareholders the goals were easier to achieve than the company was acknowledging and that internal projections showed musk was quickly going to qualify for large portions of the pay package  shouldnt you have some idea before forming such a strong opinion  people here will argue that the board had some super secret understanding that they were actually going to meet the growth targets and therefore the agreement was not made in good faith that of course is absurd every company has overlyoptimistic internal goals and growth targets and believes they have a plan to meet those targets

had the growth not occurred the same people would be chastising the board for being too optimistic

have you ever seen pitch decks from startups the logic applied in this thread would have you believe that investors in startups are being duped because the founders of those startups are internally confident in their growth

the fact that the growth happened is making everyone delusional and blind to how the plan was evaluated by experts at the time of its creation you could have told every stock analyst and expert in the world at the time that teslas board was 100 certain they would meet the growth targets and nobody would have meaningfully moved their analysis because of course the board is optimistic

and putting all of that aside even if you were convinced that the board was 100 certain they would meet their targets despite all risks to the contrary the structure of the plan would mean you would 10x your investment the gymnastics necessary to paint this as bad for investors is truly remarkable  you cant project 2 different scenarios publicly and privately  i mean the judge with literally 1000x the information and legal knowledge that you have disagrees so i dunno  maybe youre wrong 

like for you to say theres nothing illegal here is genuinely hilarious what gives you the authority or even confidence to declare that  she is the highest court for these matters  lmfao listen to yourself man  bruh what when it is inconvenient it is bureaucracy  amen  removed  most people dont have close ties to their employers most employers wont breach their duties to the shareholders to grant a ridiculous pay package a package with metrics they were already on track to make most people dont have the ability to tank a company if they dont get that pay package one that was determined by a court to be flawed and not in the shareholders interest  no her logic was original pay package was illegal and voided it having a shareholder vote to reinstate does not apply to state law as remedy delaware is known for having the best corporate courts as it protects all parties  it doesnt matter if you were informed after the fact the original pay package was already rescinded by then you cant override a court ruling with a shareholder vote they needed to go through the correct process by creating a new plan and following the required procedure

its a failure of corporate governance it exposes just how captive the board is  minority shareholders still have rights and a company still has a fiduciary duty to them if you and a bunch of familyfriends all own 51 of a company you cant just collude to vote to dilute the minority shareholders to enrich yourself  is there a reason u want to dilute your stock value thats overvalued enough already you think musk did something to deserve that  you understand that many of the shareholders now are different from the shareholders then right that damage could have been done to people as a result of their lies and that the solution isnt well just get the new guys to agree  her position was that it was illegal not just misinformed but illegal to begin with 

i mean how isnt it a conflict of interest for that board to even sit on the board they are supposed to represent shareholders interest not personal interest and she caught them red handed by saying one thing to investors while saying something else internally this is obviously a conflict of interest and goes against all public company laws 

what elon needs to do is remove the public shareholders by taking it private  the lawyers who sued get 300 million off the tesla shareholders they charged for their hard work

elon will have to sell a huge chunk of tesla shares to cover the additional taxes from the new issue since the old one isnt being allowed further costing shareholders

this court is a joke for this precedent and it will result in companies leaving who do not want to even the possibility of such a lawsuit coming their way  whats the reason you voted to approve this btw to me it seems silly hes gonna take all profits out of tesla to what pay off twitter debt  deleted  helping so many successful companies seems to show a common denominator once sure he got lucky twice there could be an argument he was lucky 3 times i dont think so  youre very naive if you really think that elon is absolutely not a product of luck he didnt just stumble his way into becoming the richest person on earth and being at the helm of multiple multihundred billion dollar companies im personally not a huge fan of his anymore based on the direction hes gone in recent years and how immature he is but theres no way you can attribute his success to luck  teslas return the past 5 years can almost entirely be attributed to naïve investors that believe fraudulent claims musk has made about robotaxis full self driving ai etc the companys performance has been quite lackluster

teslas annual revenue growth was 343 in 2023  in comparison fords was 446 tesla isnt even growing faster than their competitors anymore but investors continue to price them as if they are going to grow 50 yoy for the next decade

musk can delay losses by continuing to make bold promises to pump the stock but eventually their lack of growth will catch up to them

ive been called an idiot for not buying zm stock in september 2020 not buying squareblock in august 2021 not buying tdoc in feb 2021 etc hype can drive prices up an enormous amount in the short term but only actual results can drive long term returns  its like they think a company can do whatever it wants as long as shareholders vote for it

its going to be unbelievable to people reading about this era in 50 years time they are going to be so confused that people were so incredibly stupid right at the era in human civilization when information became more widespread and more easily accessible than ever before  its honestly so maddening and sad at the same time so many people think they genuinely know the law better than a judge a judge with literally 1000x the information on the case and 1000x the legal training its fucking crazy  it must be past your bedtime there kiddo if a judge ruled the package was illegal you cant overturn that with a vote like holy shit you cant actually believe thats how the law works the court said this was illegal but we voted that it was legal so its legal  this is one of the funnier threads ive seen on reddit genuinely  still an illegal pay package though so go back to the drawing board and try again  teslas own internal projections showed that the targets werent crazy and that they expected to achieve those goals

none of that changes the fact that they didnt follow the rules during the initial shareholder vote  2nd package isnt for a new payment it was done in the hopes of fixing the first one and that is not possible if they want they can probably hold a new vote for a new package  rule of law

which law was broken  this is one of the biggest strawmans ive seen in a while  if tesla shareholders voted to burn 50b that would be legal but paying someone their agreed salary is not that judge is just being a ahole because technically law allows them to and they are a sore looser 


imagine if judge decided your pay is excessive because you ocassinally browse reddit in office and orders you to repay all of your earnings for last 7 years then your company said no they are good worker and earned their salary but judge still forced you to repay it all back and company could be sued if they gave you the money back because thats not in the shareholder interest and that judge would surely rule against the company if they repaid you  this isnt rule of law lol this is corporate governance this is basically the government sticking its nose to where it doesnt belong  the original verdict from the judge said tesla and elon needed to renegotiate the pay package because the shareholders werent informed that the pay package wasnt vetted by an independent party like they claimed it was and that that the internal projections showed different growth rates for which the company shared publicly  they arent supposed to try and validate an invalid pay package by retroactively holding a vote under threat of musk crashing the stock price if he didnt get his way propose a new package and do it legally  youre  seems like a trivial distinction but then again its 18x the lawyer fees lol like wtf  who are you to decide what others should be paid you basically want to uproot the fundamental of capital market elon grew tesla from 50 billion market cap to 1 trillion market cap i would say if any ceo deserves to be paid it would be elon  the wild thing was that they did actually find he had manipulated the share price in effect they found him liable he just didnt get any punishment because the judge decided that no one was harmed its crazy that you can manipulate a stock get caught and then get away with it  it was punished 
he was made to step down as ceo by the sec  based  whoa dude that would be about 35m worth of shares today 

instead you sold for what 2m  what was unlawful about the pay package the original ruling said poor disclosure opened them to a fairness challenge but the new package was disclosed based on the case  

this ruling is trash and everyone can see it  the other issue the judge pointed out was that the directors chosen to set exec compensations were not independent from musk  the issue is that the case has already been decided and a party cant just do something completely within its control and ask the judge to reopen the case  it might have been a different outcome if they revoted before the judge made her initial decision  but once that decision is made you are basically done developing the facts of the case  it almost sounds like musk is skirting some laws by not having the proper disclosures i wonder what he is hiding  so its illegal


 they can easily make a new one that compiles with the law  why bother commenting on something that you havent even taken 5 minutes to research  they created massive wealth by stopping tesla from losing 56000000000 in value  everyone keeps repeating omg but the shareholders voted11 with seemingly no understanding of the legal issues at play

the compensation package is illegal to begin with it doesnt matter how many times shareholders vote on an illegal package courts will continue to overturn and block an illegal package they cannot approve something the law does not allow  bod conflict of interest proxy statements  from getting what they want  private companies could have a board they could have shareholders waiting for a shareholder to sue you is not in any way shape or form the same as public company oversight who the hell is even in this sub anymore is wallstreetbets leaking can someone check the fucking seals around that cesspool  blocks you  hey gas stations need strippers too  thank you for your service  now is your break over or what these nickels aint gonna throw theyselves

if it turns out youre a kindergarten teacher or something ill feel really bad about this  so please if thats the case just lie to me  im pretty gullible  comment i replied to said per year this site really has hit an all time low on reading comprehension   they work for money


as do all the engineers production workers designers quality testers etc you know the people that do the things that create value  can you introduce me to mr vanguard  i mean first of all sole proprietorship definitely exists but sure i know what youre trying to say

i think you overindexed on that first rhetorical sentence i was replying to someone implying that elon took the company to 1t yes he played a large role but many other people did as well and im sure their compensation is orders of magnitude smaller  i think its worth pointing out that i never claimed any of the things youre seeming trying to refute

im simply claiming that 56b is a vast overpayment of services rendered by musk as you said the shareholders should be making money and the reason the judge is striking this down is that its not good for the shareholders that 56b can be put to far better use for the company giving all that to musk wouldnt be in service to the shareholders andor the company  youre close the board of directors didnt approve the package they recommended its approval to shareholders who voted for it 

the court said the link between musk and the board who recommended the pay package was not disclosed well enough to shareholders for them to make an informed decision  they can be president but at least they cant vote s  even a person with alzheimers can be installed as president   the electoral college is that 


just to clarify the electoral college system was in theory supposed to be that but it isnt that in practice in modern times its original idea was to be a check on the public for a fear that direct elections would produce bad results so instead the states would pick electors who would make the decision on the peoples behalf but not necessarily locked to whatever the popular wishes were pretty quickly the electoral college participants became a rubber stamp mechanism merely there to cast a predetermined vote but that wasnt the original intent for them  smart isnt the right word here though i agree with your sentiment the us political system is captured by the rich for sure but most of those politicians have also put themselves into the position intentionally to be lobbied for selfenrichment the problem is the various layers and layers of systems have made it too difficult to weed out the cruel and selfish from politics by layers i mean the education system newsjournalism all levels of politics etc  not at all how it works 

the moment a pay package to someone that violates shareholders fiduciary responsibility is announced the value of the shares decline immediately

so yes actually they are held at gun point at the value their shares they should be worth  the new board approved the new package they also revised the disclosures and package to cover every issue she raised 

lawfare from deleware is the truth  but tesla fanbois think they do  oh no somebody who actually read what the judge wrote  how was the first one illegally done what law was broken  your missing their point the 72 support was from all shareholders apart from musk and his brother it would be like if the 51 shareholder wanted something to pass and still 72 of the remaining 49 wanted it to pass  still wasnt a new pay package it was the same pay package resubmitted 

thats where the issue is they need to propose a new pay package  it doesnt matter the shareholders opinions the original package was illegal  even better publicly set small goals consistently beat them thereby boosting the stock price  if thats so how is it that outside independent analysts were so far out what caused that divergence  to be honest i wasnt aware there was any controversy between what the board was saying and what was being discussed publicly 

i cant recall the numbers but musk needed to something like 10x the company it seemed asinine at the time  people here will argue that the board had some super secret understanding that they were actually going to meet the growth targets and therefore the agreement was not made in good faith that of course is absurd

the judge presiding over this case didnt seem to think so and wouldnt the targets only qualify as overlyoptimistic if they werent able to hit them  actually you can and theres a word for it fraud  you shouldnt do it though unless youve got like a brazillion dollars for lawyers  at the time elon was publicly stating 50 growth yoy for the next 10 years and was clowned on regardless of what was said privately the public disclosed package is the actual pay contract the bod should always be more optimistic than the public thats why they are on the board and get the insights  those kind of statements are going to limit you in everything you try to achieve in life my friend  until they appeal it to the delaware supreme court  she is not  the owners of the company should be able to pay the ceo whatever they decide its their company its their money they can spend or invest or however they want

why should the government get to tell the owners of the company that they arent allowed to pay their employee x dollars because some random judge doesnt like it 

the owners of the company have made it very clear that they want to pay their employee this much who is the judge protecting 

this is supposed to be a free country let them pay employees whatever amount they want  atlas shrugged the only winners here are the lawyers with millions in legal fees



the system needs a reboot  removed  when the pay plan was conceived in 2018 the kpis were so insane nobody thought he would hit them

thats why his compensation was so insane because the goals needed to unlock them were equally so insane

remember in 20182019 tesla was weeks from running out of cash and closing their doors not even apple would give them a lifeline  she should reverse her ruling is the point 

her imagination of how teslas ceo pay package should be negotiated was proven wrong by the tesla shareholders overwhelmingly  her argument is that the ceoboard relationship made the negotiation of the presented pay package to shareholders illegal shareholders learned all that info still voted for it even after having the gains enough of their relationships was public knowledge in the first place too we dont need to know if someone goes to someone elses wedding  there werent any lies not telling us who went to whos wedding is normal 

stock price has already gained the value technically no financial incentive to vote for it twice we voted for it the second time to prove the companys current owners want to pay it  her saying bc x went to ys wedding and didnt disclose in the proposal  the proposal is corrupted is ridiculous and is dangerous for shareholder rights in general i expect that level of camaraderie from the leadership or businesses  it was already approved most people believe that shareholders should not have the risk of a judge overruling their democratic vote

elon also was considering leaving the company if the vote was not approved fair considering that he was being denied something that the owners of the company already agreed to pay his stated reason for needing shares is to maintain sufficient control of the company  which is a large reason it is valued as it is if elon left or had insufficient control of the company it would most likely decrease in value badly costing shareholders  first the pay package is for shares not cash 

second we voted for it because it is based on performance teslas valued more than all other car companies combined today because musk made it more than a car company he could have spent his time as space x or started another company but we got him to grow tesla he did his end of the deal he should get the compensation we agreed to pay him  you know it isnt to pay him all at once he hit the goals he gets paid simple as that tesla stock and elon changed my life went from renting to owning multiple investment properties along with my now primary residence

got in super early and kept buying since 2013 so i want the man to be paid  what you do with your money is your decision same goes for me and my money and same for elon silly or not our opinions on how someone else spends their money is irrelevant

i also approved it again because i approved it the first time around it was a long shot back then and he achieved it the returns from my investment say hes rightfully earned it more than that call me sexist but i believe a man should honor his bond  that is not what that means lol  meaning they will still give him the pay package

they cant give him the original 56b package  so they have to pay him some where else  it means the judge is forcing tsla to pay 350million dollars to bernstein litowitz  grossmann who represented a shareholder with a total of 7 shares  you dont need a law or business degree to recognize clear moral bankruptcy but go off einstein  this guy is all over the thread defending elon absolutely hilarious stuff  how was the second one illegal 
i understand they pursued it to convince the judge but its still valid on its own right   right its a fucked up thing billions of dollars  that didnt really change anything   yeah

  
i mean im doing fine but it would have been nice  it wasnt a new package  yeah when your cousin personal lawyer and drug dealer are on the board kinda not independent  crooked board members lol  well when youre trying to get a pay package for more than the company has made in net income since the company was founded  yep its mind boggling people are in here defending him im wondering if they are bots

obviously the dude tried to move to texas and run a revote to skirt some laws i wouldnt be surprised if the 78 approval vote was gerrymandered to shit somehow

for whatever reason this judge thinks its bs and id bet it is  tesla never lost 56000000000 in value the pay package is a done thing it was done years ago  so the board ignored their fiduciary duty  it seems pretty simple god forbid the poor guy has to sell a few shares to fund his ambitions  plus those shareholders who voted arent usually your neighbor  there are also shareholders that vote against things those shareholder need protection when the majority was obtained improperly  people who get scammed also do so voluntarily  you do realize this whole thing was started by a shareholder suing tesla and the bod it had nothing to do with the additional oversight faced by public companies that exact same thing can happen with a private company tesla being a private company would not have necessarily prevented this situation from occurring  dude is riding elons dick so hard  if any one of these can make me one trillion as elon did i would definitely pay them 56 billion  
  
sometimes even few simple decisions means that resources those talented people are spend much much better and thus creates much more value for everyone than if those decisions were different  
  
so its more of an point of view  ceos doesnt create value but they do decide about allocation of huge resources if they can get 10x value out of same work of same people or even more  i think they are vital to pushing humanity further  
  
for example without tesla success we could have been burning fossil fuels in cars for decades longer as established players fought to keep status quo until tesla made it impossible and thus global warming would be much worse those talented individuals would probably be working on better combistion engines world would be far worse off  its not 56b in cash theres no better use for it the judge isnt making a judgement on if its too much money theyre saying the board had certain conflicts of interest even if the pay package was 10b the lawsuit would apply  first you said if he did that alone that he would deserve it but that he doesnt deserve it because it was all done by employees not ceo the point is thats the job of ceo to bring in employees so good that company grows immensely not to create innovations by themselves  
it is nice in hindsight to say that these 56 billion could be spent better but tell any company shareholders that you have an ceo that could make them one trillion dollars and that he is requesting pay of 56 billion to do that and he only gets paid if he accomplishes that  
no shareholder in the world would tell you that this would be a waste of their money and they could spend them better  
after the fact when shareholders already got their paycheck yeah its unreasonable   the court said the link between musk and the board  was not disclosed well enough

its not just about disclosure the board has a fiduciary duty to negotiate a fair ceo pay package on behalf of tesla investors the failure to do so is one of the reasons why the initial pay package was struck down it may have played a factor in the recent ruling too i have not read the opinion yet

the problem that all the tesla fanboys dont understand is that a vote is not a replacement for negotiations shareholders were presented with a binary choice which represented two extremes overpay elon by an extravagant amount or pay him nothing and risk him leaving the company both extremes are horrible for shareholders these options amounted to a game of chicken the shareholders could yield and overpay elon by a large amount or they could gamble the fate of the company and their investment hoping that elon would back down the boards clearly failed to act as a fiduciary again

the ability to negotiate breaks the stalemate imposed by the game of chicken with greatly reduced risk elon has a large fraction of his personal wealth tied to tesla this gives the board leverage the board can call his bluff in rounds of negotiations with little risk to the company a competent board acting as a fiduciary should be able to negotiate a much better deal for shareholders than either options presented as a vote  he was convicted in new york felons can vote if not in jail in new york
yes i understand this was sarcasm

edited charged to convicted cuz i used the wrong word for some reason  found the election denier  the decision is right there for you to read  so by submitting the package again only getting 1 share less is that considered a new pay package  shockingly people inside the company tend to know more about it than those outside   outside independent analysts

the board was stacked with nonindependent directors the board was essentially a mouthpiece for musk and was publicly saying one thing while privately saying another

that was the whole basis for the shareholder lawsuit that kicked this off that minority shareholders have inalienable rights and 51 of the shareholders cannot simply vote to enrich themselves or a 3rd party at the expense of the other 49

this is not a new thing and has been a principle since at least 1919 and ford vs dodge ironically another car company  maybe try reading an article about it there must be one around here so oh yeah its the op  i repeat a later point you could have told any analyst or expert in 2018 that the tesla board was 100 certain they would meet their targets doing so would not have meaningfully changed their analysis the fact that the board saw a path to meeting the goals and were confident in their ability to execute means they were like any other board or company leadership you could have told the shareholders that meeting the goals was considered a certainty by the board and it would not have changed the shareholder vote outcome how do i know this because we all know the outcome now and the recent revote reapproved the plan with full knowledge that the goals were already met

shareholders would obviously approve the plan even with full knowledge that the board was 100 certain that it would succeed because doing so meant the shareholders would 10x their investment if you could enter into an investment with that level of payout and absolute certainty of success you would approve such plans every single time

its a weird hindsight bias to now say well hey the board was optimistic and predicted this outcome so i guess thats fraud meanwhile every other board on the planet has similar optimism and doesnt meet their goals but no one cares because boards are always optimistic  nah this isnt some appeal to authority issue man essentially everyone in this thread has read next to nothing on this case and do not understand it at all yet are making wide sweeping and definitive claims i am quite confident that letting these uninformed children literally i bet most are like 15 years old go unchecked wouldnt expand my horizons in life  deleted  the owners of the company should be able to pay the ceo whatever they decide its their company its their money they can spend or invest or however they want

theres no problem with paying ceos thats totally legal as long as you go through the right channels and dont break any laws if you dont want to go through those channels go private and you wont have to deal with it  blame him making it a public company if it was private he can pay himself whatever he wants  once you make it public you now follow the laws  you cant have your cake and eat it too  youre poor calm down with the russian points lmao  i think youre not understanding that the original package was illegal doesnt matter what elon or tesla fanboys think the vote doesnt make the package less illegal  congrats bro  man or woman honor knows no sex  deleted  haha and yet here we are with droves of lemmings trying to defend teslas morally bankrupt corporate governance 

i know they arent the brightest but its a pretty simple case and a cut and dry outcome  voting on the package doesnt make the package not illegally created

go back and try again with a new proposal  in the board game  contest this is to you youre correct  where it started has nothing to do with where it is now which is exactly what this thread is about what is happening now is entirely based on public company oversight

do you think if you say maybe possibly could be and reference scenarios that arent the topic at hand that you sound right you sound lost  i understand its not cash i never claimed it was

there definitely exists better uses than giving it to the richest man on the planet for example use it for compensation for other people they can use it to hire more engineers scientists and designers rather than just juicing the guy at the top  deleted  convicted  i wasnt sure what president he was talking about lol  the most famous republican president before trump had actual alzheimers  i read it it was about board independence and disclosure 

tesla has changed chairs and brought in new independent directors since 2018 and the plan was disclosed to cover the issues raised at the hearing 

this is fuckery  you could have told any analyst or expert in 2018 that the tesla board was 100 certain they would meet their targets doing so would not have meaningfully changed their analysis

thats because the board lied in their disclosure independent analysts can only make good calls with good information and the judge ruled that the information kept from the shareholders made the difference even in hindsight the targets look more impressive if the state of the company was fraudulently represented  musk and tesla can appeal to the delaware supreme court as soon as mccormick enters a final order which could come as soon as this week the appeal could take a year to play out

literally from the reuters article linked in the post

edit lol the guy who asked for this source just messaged me to go kms  how was it illegal  she said the board and ceo were too closefriendly to have shareholders vote on the pay package but later the shareholders were told all that info and still voted for it 

its ok for ceos and boards have friendly relations it happens all the time in business  why was it illegal though  thanks  since youre going there how dare you forget the rest of the alphabet soup and the  sign

anyway i can only speak for myself and the values i was taught and raised with i am not one that shakes hands and back stabs later  but how like what specifically was illegal about the proposal and how does it differ from the new proposal havent seen anyone explain why  it was a new proposal it was the same numbers but proposed again and with proper disclosures   you truly dont seem to have any idea how the us legal system works or the relevant legal factors in this case youre just wrong and screaming personal insults because you dont have any actual argument to make

for example elon is currently suing openai and its board of directors because he thinks they failed in their fiduciary duty he is able to do that even though openai is a private organization  the shareholders feel juicing the guy at the top will lead to higher returns than without him it has nothing to do with elon being the richest person in the word 

im not an elon fanboy nor am i directly invested in tesla but im inclined to agree with them if elon walks away tesla stock will drop a lot the shareholders want to retain him and they decided theyre happy with paying him 56b  he did  i think youre missing my point

setting aside what the board disclosed assume they had in 2018 disclosed everything that we know now because all boards are optimistic and because nobody can actually predict the future no analysts worth their salt would have been meaningfully moved by the knowledge that the board is 100 certain that they will meet these goals

we all know that analysts such as those on cnbc laughed at the hilarity of the compensation plan at the time you cant honestly think they would have mocked it any less had it been accompanied by a statement from the board saying effectively we can guarantee this outcome it would likely have been mocked even more strongly what naivety

if time travel were possible you could time travel to 2018 and tell an analyst everything we know today and show them this ruling along with all accompanying paperwork and unless they actually believed you were a time traveler they still wouldnt believe you if you said tesla will meet all of the goals early because forwardlooking plans in the real world carry risk of failure

and this is why the particular argument that the judge has made about this compensation plan is merely delaying the inevitable either the decision will be appealed and overruled by the delaware supreme court or the company will create a new compensation plan with all necessary disclosures and it will again be approved by a majority of shareholders shareholders overwhelmingly approve compensating the ceo with the agreedupon share print because they made an absolute killing on their tsla investment and the right thing to do is stick with the original compensation plan regardless of whether the original disclosures were all buttoned up  tesla board didnt state their full relationship with elon

tesla board stated the pay package was vetted by an independent party it wasnt

tesla board put out growth projections but lied about how achievable they were publicly they were projected as a moonshot to the public but internally it was stated the projections were in reach

this lead to shareholders being lied to by the board and elon  it wasnt a new proposal 

it was the same proposal elon doesnt want to pay the taxes that come with rewriting the new proposal which is why he thinks he can get away with this workaround  that has nothing to do with this post quite literally nothing here let me try yesterday i saw a duck eat some bread 

youre a teenager youre edgy i get it but youre not talking about the topic at hand youre just angry that i insulted you for being an inexperienced 14 year old in a stock subreddit id be angry too if i was 14  thanks  personal insults the last refuge of a fool who has lost an argument  thanks

youre welcome",0.7335,1.0,1

KO worth it for the dividends?,so if you had a large chunk of money and dont want very much risk but also want to receive a dividend is ko coca cola the best choice if i can get the dividend to be a certain amount for myself while taking on minimal risk to me it seems logical anyone else invested do you pocket the dividends or reinvest,jman7784,2024-12-04 03:04:15,23,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h5yuu7/ko_worth_it_for_the_dividends/,,"id go schd over ko better yield and you get the diversification  ko trading at lows you would probably get 40 gain on your principal as well  no id get a dividend etf instead of one company  single company is not minimal risk it is high risk you want an etf pick one of any number of dividend etfs assuming you want to invest in equities for potential growth otherwise there are actual minimal risk options like treasuries  ive had ko since 1997 and its usually been a fairly safe gamble all things considered a 3 dividend is pretty good  305 is not much of a dividend but ko is pretty safe

try f ford stock 555 dividend yield as of today and ford isnt going anywhere trades in a range of 10 up to 14 typically you may hate the vehicle but the stock is about as safe as they come

another one is mercedesbenz group ag symbol mbgaf trades in a typical range of 50 to 75 per share dividend yield is 1018 as of today only pays once a year though  you can get 45 with almost zero risk in bonds and money markets so i never understand the logic in choosing a stock that pays dividends lower than that for the express purpose of using it for income  schd  i sell way otm covered calls 1 year out to generate 12 yield on my longterm holdings

either the big tech stocks double in one year 57t market cap or i collect extra income

i never sell covered calls in a weak market only in situations like today where theyre at healthy prices and i see 100 upside as close to 0 probability 

it works well if you are patient and dont get greedy doesnt reduce risk but it is effectively doubling dividend income for minimal downside  look up miller  modigliani dividend irrelevancy theory any company not paying a dividend can reinvest in itself at an interest rate equal to their roe so in theory you could just sell a portion of your shares to simulate a dividend even if the company isnt paying a dividend just look into it i personally dont look twice at divs because of it glhf  youre in the wrong thread my friend go ask this question in a dividend thread youll get better answers and advice from people who know about capital appreciation  ko is fine but cody is gonna crush him at saturday nights main event brother  you can just hold cash and get a higher interest payment than the coke dividend  kmi  no  ko dividend is about 3    you can get 45  in money market funds  

the dividend is a qualified one which is tax advantaged  but only makes sense if you are at a high tax rate  no  id just go tsly and nvdy theyre also counted as capital gains instead of dividends so youre taxed at the lower capital gains rate

if you want diversification  then ymax or ymag  ko mo xom pep cvs csco are all decent divvy payers and fairly safe  why not diversify a bit  i also like v and ma  i think it is worth for the dividends if you can snatch it at a very good div yield ratio i bought some ko in the low 50s last year and dont regret it a bit

its gonna outperform government bonds in the long run by some margin while being a simple stupid business even a monkey could run

what you do with the dividends kind of depends on you they are not tax efficient so you should ponder why would you want ko for the dividends

i like stocks that gives dividends and buy bonds as well to have more cash to act when markets go in the deep red

but i can also tell you that since the market keeps going green and green and theres not that many corrections to act upon its been so far not a winning strategy

still i like the cash i receive each month i like my investment strategy it fits me but still in hindsight i left gains here and there that keep compounding no regrets but need to learn from that  imo dividend stocks are dead ends theyre companies that are done growing why invest 100 to be paid 1 when you could be paid 150  no bonds offer better yields for practically no risk  t  not much risk and large chunk of money 

buy spy low risk and your money will double every 7 or 8 years  buy ko and nike  buy bils or sgov instead much less risk  yea why not  honestly its pretty safe  ko and mo both have decent dividends and teriible consequences for the users of the products  that fact enters into my choices on investing   i think there will be less use of both  boxx  with trump in office no  second this  if dividends were the objective id split among jepi jepq qyld ryld and svol  im currently contributing to vti my goal is to obtain enough dividends to help me as much as possible erasesoften certain expenses from my life while not selling anything  the thinking would be stocks might pay a lower dividend but may also appreciate more than bonds for example schd is up 14 ytd while also paying a 35 dividend   you can get 45 with almost zero risk in bonds and money market

this is ending soon  lol youre right but be prepared to be downvoted into oblivion  my goal is to strengthen my income thru dividends while getting small gains on my principle with as small risk as possible currently the majority of cash is in cds getting 46447 interest but obviously the principle isnt changing  i  why spy instead of voo  agreed should also have some concerns if foodbeverage industry sees health reform under trump administration could be rocky times for some of the big foodbeverage names if strict regulations come down on them  youre probably better off buying bonds for fixed income  a 30 year treasury will give you 45 of tax free returns  theres essentially no risk as long as you arent looking to sell the bond  look into spy and duk solid additions  op though did ask if ko is worth it for the dividends and mentioned literally nothing else  i get that this can happen so maybe this would be a way to help beat inflation  these rates fluctuate yes but you dont know that its ending soon  t  the risk is significant inflation which is a serious risk  americans pay zero tax on tbill interest income

damn in canada interest income even off govt bonds is the worst type of income to have as its taxed at the highest rate possible  dividends are bad actually youre just giving someone money so they can borrow it for free before paying you your own money back you should be thinking about total return not dividend yield  thats true but i was responding to the comment from okapex i responded to op in a different in general you would pick a dividend stocketf over a bond because you want to capture growth as well as yield bonds are much more about yield capture  i could have phrased it better but i meant that there is no risk of losing money  you are right in that there is risk in bonds  its not just treasury bills  municipal bonds and certain private bonds are also tax free  i dont know all the rules that determine whether a private bond is taxed or not but the exempt bonds are usually things that provide a common good like utilities or railroads   zero tax on tbill interest income

not quite treasuries are exempt from state and local taxes assuming those exist where the investor lives not everywhere does treasuries are still subject to federal taxeshttpspubliccomlearnhowaretreasurybillstaxed

state and city bonds are roughly the other way around generallyhttpswwwschwabcomlearnstorynotalwaystaxfree7municipalbondtaxtraps exempt from federal tax and may be exempt from state tax too particularly if the bonds were issued by the investors home state  1 op wants fixed income not capital growth  with that in mind bonds are a better investment because of the higher yield taxfree returns and negligible risk
2 thats not how dividends work unless you are putting your money in a ponzi scheme  dividends are a portion of earnings paid out to shareholders not a portion of invested funds  if that were the case then companies like coke that have paid dividends consistently for decades would have run out of money to pay out a long time ago  it is entirely possible to invest money in a company and get more than you invested in yearly dividends  take apple for example  if you invested 1000 dollars into apple in 1984 youd be receiving 8333 dollars in dividends every year
3 no shit you should thinking about total return and not just dividend yield  the thing is dividends are part of total return",0.7543,0.999,1

Rivian's potential $6.6 billion DoE loan catches eye of Musk-Ramaswamy's DOGE,"rivians potential 66 billion doe loan catches eye of muskramaswamys doge  rivianisthttpswwwrivianistcomblogsnewsrivian66bdoeloanscrutinizedmuskramaswamydoge

it appears to have started the goal seems to be the utilization of government resources to establish a monopoly 

the question is whether there are checks and balances left in place to at least slow down such widespread corruption

he is pushing hard to be the first and the biggest oligarch in the united states 

can anything positive come out of this  

",M_Equilibrium,2024-12-03 04:41:19,473,154,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h58s1w/rivians_potential_66_billion_doe_loan_catches_eye/,,"going after your competitor where have i heard this projection before   it seems like this new doge has a lack of focus looks like its well on its way to being another worthless government entity draining more taxpayer funds for little to no benefits for americans  weird it is like they are just targeting elons competition   if it isnt this clown it would be the newly nominated director of the doe who oil ceo who scrutinizes it 

and viveks argument is laughable so its political to approve the loan but not political to cancel it and they arent forking over the money its a loan also 880k per job yeah if you look at it over one year most jobs last longer than one year buddy  i honestly still cant get over the fact doge is a real department i cant take anything serious after the words elon and the doge are proposing like what fucking bizzaro world are we in that this is a real sentence  conflict of intrest much  oh yes the walking welfare case who built his empire on government subsidies in the tens of billions would like to eliminate competition  im shocked  the us goverment is about to be run by a bunch of comedians that just happen to be billionaires  leon is an absolute genius 200mm spend in a few months to achieve 69420 returns  doge will most likely do 5 of whats they are promising in headlines  and it will take many years of legal battle to take away  a 66 billion contract and by then the 4 year run will be over 

doge could  work with an 8 year time frame  its going to just be a headline grabbing attack on things democrats like to make them look bad  theyre saying the wacky stuff about firing all the government workers to distract from the blatant corruption  removed  used to be a time when criminals used to try and keep this kind of securities and financial crime under the radar  now theyre just doing it in broad daylight  i have a feeling yall might wanna drop rklb while youre at it  giving 66 billion to a company charging 90k for an suv doesnt seem like a great investment of resources not gonna lie  high amount  super  this committee can advise trump to cancel this loan on january 20th and this would be like reason 100 to have minor concern over this stupid committee 

its not a battle worth picking at even though its a sign of the times  only question is do you own enough of tsla to not even care anymore 

because no one cant do shit about it anymore 
us citizens choose this 
for once i am happy to bé french lol  imagine being rivian right now or intel or micron or applied materials or global foundries or gm or stellantis

you got the money you got the agreement but you cant even use it but your future plans depend on it all because of the uncertainty caused by two unelected jackasses who throw everything into instability

this is fucked for long term planning if this is how the country will work  glad to see the 20s are the 20s no matter what century theyre in fitzgerald spinning in his grave  the goal is to make people dependent on government once you have someone depend on you you own them  this is what america voted for and wants  i hate this stupid autistic mother fucker so much  the lobbying scene is going to be a battle for the ages  no conflict of interest here at all none whatsoever  just straight up hypocrisy   something good can come out of this 


buying puts on rivian lol  if i was rivian  id sue im sure there is some law here that musk is trying to bend  maybe yes maybe not  oh no not doggys leaders  completely disagree musk has shown that he doesnt want the government to help tesla when he stated in an interview that he thought ev subsidies from the government were bad is that the type of person who will use their political power to screw over a competitor i dont think so hes much more values driven than people realize

edit to be clear hes not a nice guy however he has proven to follow his values even if its bad for him or his companies  everyone attacking elon but just ignoring that the gov was just going to give rivian 66 billion what a clown show of a sub  is this a damn joke im pretty sure the doe doesnt need to be handing over billions to them or any other automaker just to make a plant  when you have been around for 15 years dont turn a profit and lose significantly on each product you sell

might not be the best idea time to let rivian out to pasture  master tape ceo of goodyear tires could be the tittle wasting money while they prep you for hardship in the years ahead absolutely a scam department jobs  in economic  disadvantaged areas with good salaries paying taxes and buying homes is not part of 2025 projects objective expansion of competition for elfon  the same way he did is unfair  voter approved so hear we go  exactly shat i said about rivian

i was bullish on rivian but with elon controlling where the money goes it will go to him way before his competitor

like it or not it is what it is there is nothing we can do that saving ourselves and profit of the situation  i expect elon to do this with his actual competition but rivian is not competition they are on the verge of bankruptcy and will have collapsed before they can repay that loan or even build the factory the loan is for  bigger question is what is the price tax payers are gonna pay consulting fees yada yada for doge considering its not an official department

imho this is another innovative way to pocket the pretty penny  its like a parody of itself from day 1  a ministry of efficiency has not just one bloated arsehole running it but two  and neither is even remotely qualified  and both have crooked careers  and both have massive conflicts of interest

the obvious joke is they could make it more efficient by having the more ruthless one fire the other  its literally a fake job trump invented to placate musk and vivek  complete lack of focus

pentagon cant find 1 trillion and here are elon and musk ruminating about a tiny 7 billion loan to open a factory in the us

kleptocracy right here folks pathetic


you know how conservatives always say follow the money well  palantir anduril spacex etc are all defensegovernment oriented companies all run by close friends of musk or musk himself  i think it will actually hurt us and cost a bunch of money too awesome sauce  as far as it concerns so far it doesnt use any taxpayers money all volunteers  that would be true if it were a government entity and not just some private entity that cant do anything expect propose changes to trumps government  its not even a government entity it wasnt created by congress its basically and advisory group working for free or being paid privately but elon anything they recommend needs to be approved by congress or acted upon by the secretary of the cabinet

but elon is basically potus in shadow  100 tariffs on chinese evs cancel rivians loans cancel ev tax credit which hurt teslas competitors more  lmaoooo shhhh youre onto them  almost like we could have predicted this  i like his faux outrage 

when trump imposed the tariffs on washing machines he ended up creating a bit over 1800 us jobs which cost around 820k pr job 

source page 27 conclusionhttpsbfiuchicagoeduwpcontentuploadsbfi_wp_2019611pdf   so its political to approve the loan but not political to cancel it

i mean yeah i like rivians cars but their business is disastrous is there any precedent to giving a 66b loan to a company losing billions a year thats never made any money reverting to the mean is not political

bailouts for profitable companies that get into bad weather due to external events arent necessarily political but this reeks of politics  sounds like you are long rivian   so its political to approve the loan but not political to cancel it and they arent forking over the money its a loan

if rivian is deserving of a loan they could get one one on the private market

government loans are at below market interest rates and are effectively a subsidy us taxpayers stand to lose a lot of money if rivian fails to deliver but see little benefit if rivian succeeds  its not a real department in accordance with the constitution the congress is the sole authority for establishing government departments and agencies this is because it requires federal funding and congress controls the purse strings for now  thats because its a commission not a department only acts of congress can create new departments gao and omb already do similar things but they start from the premise of how can we get the government to accomplish its mission with less funding rather than screw the mission how can i enrich elon and vivek so theyre nonstarters for the important work they want to do  were gonna look back at this time and have lots of things to explain or we go full idiocracy and just give up  its not   i described it as the internet finally taking over real life 

your real life used to be the one you felt while exploring the world around you now the fake online world is the new reality  i dont understand how even a stocks subreddit can be filled with people so attached to the democratic party that they oppose probusiness policies and ideas its a freaking stocks sub for crying out loud we are all going to make more money if someone can get rid of the ridiculous governmental tax waste and regulatory overreach whether its called doge or deeznutz

how can anyone who understands business and economy which i hope everyone a stocks sub would do be opposed to this  maybe get over yourself thatd be a start  while also getting paid tens of billions  hmmm  hes an oligarch  everything ive seen is this isnt even a thing with any actual power sure they can make suggestions but ultimately it feels like trump is annoyed with elon and vivek and wants to make them feel important  this is copeapathy that would be better spent resisting  i mean its literally impossible for it to do what was promised theres not enough discretionary spending in the us budget to cut 2 trillion in spending

not to mention a lot of the government spending thats categorized as discretionary isnt really discretionary a ton of federal agencies and even the federal court system fall under the discretionary spending category  bro none of this matters

the fact is that doge is on twitter and elon is running it

with the millions of followers elon gets on twitter  the right wing media circuit rogan fox truth social etc they can make perception reality

doge doesnt have to do anything to convince millions of americans that trump and doge shaved mountains of debt by making the government more efficient

they could lie two ways to sunday and people wouldnt even know


the idea was never to actually do anything  it was to make people think that something is being done  removed  writing a comment without understanding the context doesnt seem helpful not gonna lie  chiiiilllll bro the echo chamber is going to downvote you to oblivion for using logic   i see a lot of this talk heading to the courts if it ever tries to be more than just talk  give  tesla first started in 2003 and didnt turn a full profit year until

2020  time to let them out to pasture by having the owner of a rival company use government privileges to kill them


i dont think thats the free market you think it is  you sound like a real well educated fella  i agree with your argument but the main criticism is double standard if it were another politician came out against rivian there wouldnt be nearly as much backlash  muh rivian bags  bullish on a company on the verge of bankruptcy that just gave their only real moat away to volkswagen and allowed volkswagen to literally copy their cars at a cheaper price point is crazy  elon doesnt control where any money in government goes  elon said they arnt taking on salaries  its a monty python skit irl  the point is it will drain fund to musk and others with no benefit for the americans the fact that they arent salaried does not detract from the point made  delusional much its like trump saying in his last administration he was going to waive his wage as president but got all kinds of deals for him and his children at the expense of our government less competition in the ev auto and solar power markets will impact all of us they will fleece us whats ironic is that its being run by two immigrants   volunteer my foot zero benefit to the 2 hex nuts you say i call bs there are no free lunches and neither nut is patriot like mel gibson   yes the pigs tend to volunteer to line up at the trough  so you are saying is that there are american people who are willing to work hours and hours with no payments for a questionable department that is technically owned by a billionaire no wonder they want to kick out the immigrants people here are dumb enough to work for free s  dont forget sue openai to give elon more ownership i wonder when be goes after rklb  and call california insane for daring to keep tax credits for small ev makers like lucid and rivian  who proudly call california home

kleptocracy  biden imposed the ev tariffs trump is going to lower them  tesla got a similar type of loan for a lower dollar amount years ago elmo wants the handouts to be exclusive  if you look at rivians history  they got absolutely butt fucked by covid and then inflation and then interest rates it cost them 3 years of runway remember  the rivian r1 series was supposed to come out in 2020

i might be biased because i own a rivian

but if there is any damn car company in the world that deserves another chance it is rivian as you said  wonderful product and either the best or second best engineers in the entire automotive world working there rn  	bailouts for profitable companies that get into bad weather due to external events arent necessarily political but this reeks of politics

you say this like tesla has been raking in profits for years and years theyve not even been making a profit for 5 years lol  remember 2008 gm took loans theyre now an f1 team cha ching  so the proposal is to make government smaller by 

checks notes 

making it bigger  its not about politics 

small government may the triple crown but these 2 ponies arent the ones you should bet on to win the cup   most americans would need to know what an oligarch was before they can realise how bad it was  realistically they dont have the votes for this but if youve seen whats proposed they think they can get the supreme court to rule impoundment unconstitutional and impound at least 500 billion in funds if not more

this is much more concerning than something like this unfortunately i think they wont have the supreme court on their side on this one as it sets a bad precedent and the ultimate end will be a freeze in adding more spending than whats there but its still something to think about  removed  oh i understand the context very well a company that is far closer to bankruptcy than profitability political favors due to backlash against musk lets use this money for something that can actually move the needle for americans  hahah good thing i dont care about the imaginary clout points on social media sites ill be simping for psny tho please send them the 66 billy   yes its give  rivn is objectively a terrible company they have negative gross margins ive never seen that in my life

httpsdownloadsctfassetsnet2md5qhoeajym1ynqegc3wua9puoicd69sl0f05e92ccdc84303608170f1aa46765dex__992_3q24_shareholder_letterpdf  now do the math of how many cars tesla sold at 15 years in and what rivian is doing

i will hold your hand step by step  but pumping 66 billion is   hes not using the government to kill them hes just ending the subsidies and thats what this loan is the free market wouldve charged more interest  please invest heavily into rivian  first off its not a politician its a drug addicted psychopathic crook saying it  second any other person saying something would just be a person saying dumb things  in this case its a crook who purchased an election on behalf of his crime buddy and now has unchecked power to act on his insane and illegal delusions  yeah but hes tight with trump and trump can end a senators career if they go against him

so the question is will trump use his power to help elon or will trump gradually start to ignore him 

my money is on the 2nd trump needed musk for twitter manipulation and  he can still use the twitter part but as time goes on theres less and less to be gained from it seems intentional elon was put in basically a non govt consulting job vs something that matters hopefully trump pushes him out  what a stupid comment of couse elon musk cares whether tax money goes to rivian or tesla and blue origin or spaxex hell make billions  dont be naive compensation  salary many ways to be compensated like slowing down competitors throwing away nhsta investigations favorable deals in other countries etc  the hitchhikers guide and trump is zaphod beeblebrox  yes there are young people  with rich family background  who want to have some deeper bonds with elon musk or trump for whatever business 

the entire 8hours of no payment requirement is about filtering these people  thats definitely coming theyre gonna sneak some crap into the nasa budget so the contracting parameters specifically match spacex and no one else  source on trump lowering ev tariffs  tesla got the loan during one of the worst bad weather events in the last century rivian is getting it while the economy is thriving and there are no external factors negatively affecting their business hardly comparable

also a loan is not a handout  i can see your argument and i wouldnt have been against a loan during the covid times but we are long passed that any trouble rivian is going through now is just a result of their poor cost control like spending 13rd as much as tesla did in 2020 before even selling any cars not the markets or economy

besides rivian found plenty of funding on the capital markets giving them a government loan now is just messing with capitalism and i dont see any reason for it other than political ones if they cant survive after the incredible amounts of funding they got at insanely beneficial valuations theyre not efficient enough to be a company  whether or not rivian shouldve received that loan has nothing to do with tesla there is simply no common sense reason the government would give that loan other than political reasons  how is any of this making government bigger its not an actual department and its scheduled to be closed within 2 years after removing a significant chunk of the existing government  its definitely about politics i doubt youll find more than 25 of people who are actual independents that agree with that statement  still lost are you running out of actual political subs  just like we will hold your hand as you run away with them goalposts lol  you just completely shifted your criteria because youre just an elon d rider or a partisan hack move along now  to be fair rivian is the only ev exclusive company thats successfully launched a truck that has caught the eye of the traditional truck crowd  ford lighting is the only other i can think of but ford isnt ev exclusive

the cyberjunk is an ongoing joke when talking about work trucks  congrats on moving the goalposts i dont want to touch your hand either

tesla also has the chinese market and europe two that rivian has not entered yet

lets see those tesla sales in china once byd keeps growing   already have   i think the question here is should rivian really received 66bis this a good use of government funding or is 33b enough to build a factory these are all questions id love to know the answer to as well so happy someone is questioning it  trump cannot just end a senators careers a lot of his endorsements end up losing their races because they are often time nutjobs he can make their life uncomfortable for sure by having his cultists send death and bomb threats to his family  i didnt say he doesnt care i said he doesnt control anything and doge is nonsense  oh so things that all other politicians do or when politicians trade stocks in their personal account ahead of laws being announced or info made public ala pelosi all of them do shady things stop thinking elon is doing anything out of the ordinary  so there are butt lickers from rich people for richer people  ah yes an agency run by nepo babies sounds like it will be extremely productive  rocket must be reusable destroys any competition  were coming back to the 4d chess era remember  what was the bad weather event in jan 2010 didnt realize we loaned out money based on weather 

sarcasm aside the loans are meant to support the transition to zero emissions tesla got the loan to build a manufacturing facility in freemont california rivian is getting a loan to build a manufacturing facility in georgia 

very comparable  ill tell you what if youre right and this doesnt wind up being a boondoggle ill come back and apologize 

remindme 5 years  why do you think its called doge    
lol

you are definitely staying true to your nickname

this is so embarrassing for you  the stock is way worse than i thought please tell me you are all in since 2021 its a horrible company to invest in  its a loan that they submitted a plan for that was approved if you have questions look into what it is   he has full control over a lot of the campaign funding thats significant sway he has over them  obviously im not literally talking about trump firing them 

but trumps daughter in law is currently running the rnc which distributes a lot of funding trump got a massive percentage of the r vote in the primaries proving that maga is still very strong trump endorsing a primary challenger and talking shot about the incumbent absolutely could get the r senator replaced

look at the list of rs who have gone against trump romney chased out liz cheney chased out to survive in the r party which is now the maga party you have to go along with trump look at romney pence liz cheney nikki haley all chased off and have no political future look at trump loyalists all won reelection and are getting cabinet positions  he definitely can if he does not like a senator he will make the fbi find something about the senator and use it as blackmail

this is the new america stop living in the past  stop deflecting 

are you saying now that melon is a politician and he is doing doge for personal interests like pelosi at the same time he is volunteering for doge ridiculous

make up your mind 

is he an ordinary crook or is he the savior of democracy and volunteering for doge in the sole interest of the country

nobody sinks millions of dollars with zero returns in mind definitely not elonia   hardly comparable tesla and other oems were in the middle of the financial crisis hardship they were also the first to build evs at a time where there was hardly any funding on the capital markets for it

rivian is already public and raised at unprecedented valuations if they still cant make it in this environment saving them would be messing with capitalism and be just as bad as trying to keep ford or gm alive when they inevitably start going out of business in a few years  i will be messaging you in 5 years on 20291203 132344 utchttpwwwwolframalphacominputi202912032013234420utc20to20local20time to remind you of this linkhttpswwwredditcomrstockscomments1h58s1wrivians_potential_66_billion_doe_loan_catches_eyem072q63context3

  appreciate that looking forward to see who ended up being right  see some of us have diversified portfolios please educate the rest of us idiots where youre investing though   i have my doubts he has the power when he himself is not on the ticket

i think the gop are going to have a pretty bad midterms  your criteria for when a company should get a loan nonpublic financial hardship is not aligned with what the doe is doing which is supporting increased us based ev manufacturing both loans were created to build new ev factories

sounds like you have emotional reasons with language like unprecedented evaluations which is purely subjective also messing with capitalism is ironic considering the incoming administration which has elmo running a gov department while self dealing to his companies  holy smokes that much huh keep losing",0.7184,0.9968,1

personally i bought leaps and im holding them  pump  dump gotta recognize one when its in front of ya  youre welcome  skill issue  sometimes when the evtol company with no revenues goes up 500 you have to ask if maybe you missed the take off and your taxi left without you just throwing money at it as it flies away yeah ive been there sorry for your bags theyre gonna be heavy for a bit  you pumped the dump well done  welcome to the world of stock market where everyone makes money except for you  stellantis manufactures airframes for archer i think the ceo news is related to the dump  putting money into an evtol startup with zero revenue worth billions and expecting to make an roi is certainly a choice lol  buy more it is going to go back up souce trust me bro  i love this post so much i read it 3 times thanks op  you got caught holding the bag when its up 80 in a week its probably too late train left the station gifemotefree_emotes_packdownvote  you know this company is at a really risky stage right now right im invested in it but i also know this is gambling  it might triple or they could just as easily go out of business  cash flow is a problem from what i can see  i really want to see your weekend thesis on this stock let me guess its probably something about stock having gone up 200bullish and vtolsle big amazing market  you invested in a helicopter company after it ran up like 100 you are highly regarded sir  ya didnt stop and think that if people are raving its already pumped up  first time  dont buy at the top  congrats welcome to the club  when my 60 hit 450 i knew it was time to sell  this shit better climb back up before my calls expire in a few weeks otherwise im cooked   im in the same boat my friend put a stop loss sale for 7 and lost about 1800 but a good monday though as i recovered the rest and i do have tolerance for that loss  common occurrence since 2020 pump and dump that catches some magic you can see shit like this on a much smaller scale all the time i havent seen achr level memeing in a while but even post 2021 you had things like bbby redbox etc that saw these kinds of moves theyre just coordinated pds i have never been able to figure out how theyre orchestrated and take off maybe some whales buy a bunch of shares price goes up they and some croniesbots create hysteria online and then once they get suckers in the equation they liquidate

its too early to say if achr shareholders who bought near the top are in for a world of hurt or if this is a massive pullback its obvious that someone has off loaded a bunch of shares and it looks like a classic pd

just want to be clear that you can still make money off of these kinds of moves but huge risk i actually made like 10k from rdbx in one day just by trading shares but i also lost money on same plays  zoom out this is healthy  when everybody is on it its too late man how long have you been gamblinginvesting for  if it was under a grand you got a cheap lesson  when reddit raves about trash like achr or mstr after its already gone parabolic with no fundamentals to justify their valuation theyre probably trying to create new bag holders  deezamm  good learning experience better luck next time  imagine trying to blame some internet strangers for your own stupidity  youre truly regarded  gotta do your dd before going to dd parties  umm can i ask what did you read over the weekend that made you think 9 was a good entry point 

i literally cant find anything to justify its incredible recent run up all signs pointed to a pullback  you bought into a 0 revenue company unlicensed literally 0 product once constructed they cant even legally sell their product in the worlds largest markets china  eu  usa i mean you alright bud

its a good company yes but not worth the pump wait until they have something closer to market readiness  you gotta put even more in to keep the price high while the initial investors dump  this is nothing even it goes back all time low yes zoom out dude ask yourself if you believe in the future of this industry if u r day traders making living out of this daily  then thats different story  you and i both learned the newb leasin of provavly dont buy immediately at market open  if its a long term investment and you arent trying to make a quick buck just relax and stop watching its coming back  you guys have any idea which hedge fund was running the social media campaign on this more curious about the angle of the promotion  next time try buying before the price goes up if you do it after you might lose money   i can feel the salt oozing from this post you should never invest based on hype like the rsi was hovering around 90 when you bought the play is to buy before the massive pump and to sell a majority of your position so you are either freerolling or have a solid profit  its a meme stock now  volatile and mainly pump and dump your the bag holder now  well done  you were foolish to buy a flying car stock  next time invest in something more respectable like meme coins  the ballad of achr

oh achr a name they praised  
a gem in whispers in forums blazed  
with weekend zeal i read your lore  
and monday camei sought to explore

funds i gathered hope held high  
dreams of profit beneath the sky  
a venture bold my chance to win  
i placed my bet let fate begin

but lo the clock did mock my stride  
a fleeting moment a downward slide  
thirty minutes a cruel cascade  
a 23 cut the market bade

oh the sting the bitter twist  
a stock once hailed now plunged in mist  
yet in this loss a lesson clear  
markets thrive on joy and fear

so thank you all for the tales you spun  
for leading me where few dare run  
a wiser soul i now depart  
with scars that teach and steel my heart

for though i faltered i will rise  
with tempered hope and sharper eyes  
achr a tale ill retell  
of market dreams and how they fell

brought to you by chatgpt  no collapse i think just a buying opportunity  simple correction
the was no news  this is a meme stock you can make money in it but all depends on timing electric helicopter taxis i mean really theres pretty much no chance the company exists in five years   you bought at the literal top and youre upset at others lmao  i mean you learned exactly what you are supposed to do not blindly invest into anything that you have no idea about especially not if reddit tells you to  what was your thesis on buying this stock  same thing happened with rocket lab stock on no news it is likely just investors taking profits before year end  when you researched the stock did you somehow miss that it 3xd in a month  theres a lesson to be learned somewhere there i can almost see it  i learned the lesson you just learned during the weed stocks craze  sucks but this is why we use stop losses  welcome to the world of pd  a lot of traders been stalking this one for a short  myself included if you believe in the story keep an eye on it  because people moved on to hovr

im surprised the gambling sub wasent shut down for market manipulation at this point but i guess some big shots love to have more retails to dump their bags on  missed the train by a few weeks  fomo rarely pays off  damn sorry to hear that these are volatile stocks im used to  5 on no news but ive been puzzled about what prompted back to back 20 days must have been the reddit hype train  impulse buying a no name ticker that was getting pumped online what could go wrong  you are welcome   learn a lesson from this experience which is to buy a quality etf instead of gambling on a risky stock you build wealth slowly over time not overnight or in a matter of daysweeks  sometimes you need to close your ears and eyes to this subreddit not everything needs to be hopped on   they only have 85k shares to borrow which is insanely low  if only they invented something where you could set the stock to sell at a level that you deemed to be reasonable considering your risk tolerance and expected gain   flying cars what could go wrong  if youre holding for the long term then this shouldnt be a problem if you were hoping to cash out on quick gains you were gambling and lost  buy the dip  23 lilm says hold my beer  buy high sell low looks like youre doing it right  of course this is the one stock that a family member told me about over the holiday 

their stock picking guru penny stock gambler friend made some money on it but of course i didnt hear anything about any entryexit points not that i really care but its just interesting how new investors latch on to single tickers and i get to hear about it every single time they bring up investing  gap may be filled doubt it goes below 6 this thing caught retail attention and wsb jumped on hard the proper reaction to that is to take their money i expect to see it return back to eat highs relatively soon but i have been on this for months so its easy to say for me

if you like the company then buy the dip  not all stocks are considered to be investments some stocks are pure scamspump and dumps  yep the pump is over when reddit gets a hold of especially small caps and meme hype stocks that dont have any viable business  its a meme stock what did you expect  ive already gained 3x since investing last month and made a stop loss order last night after the news came out that stellantis ceo was quitting 



figured it would be a bloodbath monday morning



 i was right bloodbath on market open but not pre market   just wait till the next pump  last week i called both achr and joby as turds and i bought them 9 months ago while watching them plunge pleasantly surprised by the recent huge gains but i knew it was a short ride and stopped out with 30 profits  why why you ask do you know what they make who are they marketing  selling these drone helicopters to i aint bringing one to the gym grocery store or work   first you havent lost anything unless you sold next its been pretty transparent news that a possible dilution would occur pending a vote of share holders as to whether or not to issue more stocks so people are likely taking some profit before that happens sell covered calls above your purchase while the dust settles and youll be fine  i thought i was in the wsb subreddit dude they are going to make planes to transport the uber rich in urban areas  you wana invest in that

oh yeah also zero revenue  it was getting very overextended and people were fomoing into the stock at peak levels so of course thered be a sell off at some point

if the company is good and ifwhen the big institutions see value theyll carry the price back up  you should sue reddit and also pick a couple of shills below as defendants many people got their money back that way  sounds like you deserved it   exactly why i use the dreaded indicators that some seem to despise   youre welcome now put my fries in the bag  you can pretty much stay away from the majority of stocks that are celebrated on reddit  reddit seems to like companies with lots of hype and little revenue  zddrdzz do andrrzrrrrzrzrrzr and 44444rrrzxxxxxxxxxxxx4  you have to get into these stocks early there a lots of small caps with potential that havent been swallowed by pe yet

rdw asts rklb achr joby plus 10 more ive seen around here and countless others

its a gamble it really is 

the more you have the more youre willing to risk  nows your chance to buy more before it goes back up  comedy gold  lol i bought enph bc people were hyping it on here its been depreciating ever since im never listening to reddit again  i learned a long time ago that buy high sell low doesnt get you anywhere you shoulda bought smci on friday instead sold it today then bought achr today  thanks for the donation  when i get a reddit tip i usually will just buy a call or two to test the waters  like you i am losing on the achr contracts but i have until 1227 to see where this stock goes  cause it was due for a pullback what kind of question is this first time  market correction i got in at 275 and will hold at an average of 475 it should be fine on my end  lol it is all pump and dump  bubble popped  average down opportunity   well shit i just bought at 7 you should have waited for the dip  dca if you believe in the company if you dont believe in the company then idk what to tell you man  archer is a car company car companies never a good idea iong time back i bought ford for 11 even after 5 years it stayed the same learned my lesson  have seen this so many times and got burned so many times as well rklb asts lunr all the same but all of these have at least doubled and some x5 their value before they were shilled on reddit this too may have a chance long term but not without any risks
i got in with achr just a month ago and made some good money on it sold almost all except some shares last week after seeing it go crazy  newton said many years ago  something that goes up must come down so it did  some asshole was on stocktwits today claiming their planes are nothing but cgi  im guessing he was short awhile ago and losing his too  still think theyll rally back by end of year though  first welcome to gambling 

second the us markets are notorious for having an elevated premarket come crashing down in the first 10 minutes of trading  

third achr took off and was bound to retreat its why i bought puts friday expecting the price to relax over a couple weeks didnt think it would happen so fast sold my 9 puts this morning   

remember december often sees stock sales for tax related purposes  whoever told u to buy at 6 did u a disservice only few points off 52 week high major stock manipulation at archer i may have to uncover this on my channel  you got pumped then you got dumped  you bought a stock that is up over 300 in a few weeks wtf did you expect to happen they always sell off after these types of moves  gotta find the support or buy zone for short term entry or average in for longer term

under 6 looks ok  you bought after a week of like 20 gains every day and got surprised by the fact it didnt 6th one in a row no one to blame but your fomo luckily for you its probably still got some more room to go up  you bought into a company that is valued at absorbing 50 percent of the tam for helicopter sales but has yet to get an faa production cert or sell a single bird  what automatically comes to mind when reading your comment is that you are not an investor with knowledge and experience you buy based on trends and worst of all you buy out of euphoria that is when stocks are at historic highs this problem arises when people learn to use tools but lack the technical professional criteria to do so i suggest you learn about technical fundamental qualitative and market analysis so you learn to buy when theyre cheap and sell when theyre expensive furthermore a 23 drop in archer is an opportunity to lower your acquisition cost and improve your profit margin in the recovery  fomo guy  no one was raving about achr besides gamblers on wsb and if you read about it online chances are youre late to the party

next time dont fomo unless you actually believed in the company long term in which case lol flying cars  sounds like you bought in at a stupid time i bought previously set a stop loss made profit did you buy a stock that was falling hard  sounds like a dumb move on your part op  hey so let me know what youre planning next so i can inverse it  lol i found betting the opposite of what people are spamming on here tends to work out the best  just use small amounts of capital  not 23 of your investment  i mean look at all the etfs and they are only allocating like 23 towards any one thing  23 so far i think you mean at least the bags youre holding are getting lighter  uber was not profitable for how long and they didnt offer a new type of service people were well familiar with a taxi and very little customer education was needed

while this requires special infrastructure people to discover and adopt a new service if youre poor it will be too expensive for you if youre rich you will want the comfort of your own heli now theres some limited number of locations on earth where this may play out but the tam is negligible

invest in something more down to earth this is just a sexy name for a short term relationship some speculative trades for a quick profitnif youre lucky to time it  just keep holding it will come back up  pump and dump according to some people  buy more you can lower cost basis  my one regret was that i didnt load up on more puts last week for this electrical helicopter pipe dream  firm examination did not do a firm examination of the stock  its dropping so then i can buy 60k worth of calls of nvda  arent you the one who caused that huge drop if you didnt buy it would continue to surge stop blaming someone else lmao   this company is nothing more than speculative junk  achr to the moonnn  dont buy a stock that has run up so much so quickly  you bought the top after a huge run dude  proud bag holder  here  taking profit  im going to fomo into a stock i know nothing about after it has gained a ludicrous amount in a short period


wow it went down wtf its reddits fault


thank you for your donation i took profit today   still green despite the drop lollll    rklb lunr and poet also had massive dips today  something about non profitable small caps today  large caps like msft did well

im going to watch tomorrow but i may dip my toe in achrlunrpoet if there is another large dip tomorrow  look at the chart before investing  never go all in at once especially on something up  this drop was just filling gaps  you are fine  diversify around other evtol stocks  joby sfrm evtl eh  blame others for your failures nice investment strategy sure it will pay off in the long run you chased the trade im still up on achr quite a bit didnt even notice the blip today  almost like evtol is a stupid fucking idea and wont work with existing infrastructure regulation and current or near future battery technology

httpswwwaerosocietycomnewsburstingtheevtolbubbletextthe20range20problem20has20twoinversely20proportional20to20disk20area

httpsairinsightcomthecomingevtolcollapse  always set the sell limit  most traders dont know this one simple trick

unless you want to play in volatility and in general its a horrible idea to buy in the first three hours of trading if you would have abided like the dude abides you would have bought near todays bottom 

i bought some calls lets see if she runs again  1 rule for regards buy high and sell lowpreferably on margin  thank you for your exit liquidity  what part of the company do you believe in that fairly expensive and sensitive drones were going to suddenly start delivering everything for amazon the company sounds like a terrible way to profit real cash cool though you should try thinking about how a company will return value to you as a shareholder and if the business has a way of producing income that makes sense i dont feel even remotely bad for you for you buying a stock cuz everyone was raving on reddit about it without thinking how theyd make money or their financials  amazing eps  flying taxis arent real and its not dubai  you fomod into a meme

dont do that again  about time  when you see a chart go parabolic like this one did that is usually not the best time to buy  so its a prerevenue company that went from 3 to 10 in a month  theres bound to be some profit taking  is the company worth less or more than 368bil five years from now  then theres me slowly dca since 2  make sure to tell us about your next play ahead of time so we can get it before it dumps   buy the dip not the tip  you havent heard the saying once everyones talking about it its too late when it comes to stocks i guess 

you fomod into being a bag holder lol  someone bought heavy shorts on it in the past 5 days its a battle ground right now they may cash out just sell some covered calls  buy when you see something the rest of the market doesnt not the opposite way around  seems like a pump and dump hype  easy come easy go

every time i see a stock blow up i buy a put usually it is a small cap meme stock that will pump then dump i wont if it is a legit company backed by financials such as an sp500 company


a company that has 300m net income 20 employees and 50m market cap suddenly goes 10x yeah sure thatll hold  after a big run wait for a profit taking dip
never buy into fomo unless the stock dips  bro bought a meme stock at ath and came to reddit to complain  my humble opinion and advice for op is to join wsb subreddit  if he is not a member already he really belongs there  buy high sell low  collapse  lol its still up over 2x from what it was in late octoberearly november  this was a hype pump and dump scheme  at this point you have to consider that were all bots working for the stock market to take your money specifically  i immediately thought of the reddit reverse indicator  there was so much chatter about this stock last weekend  hey op theres this ticker going by pl  
dont thank me  the good old buy high sell low  take off weight doesnt work out yet  id rather get in now than when its at 1520  my guy saw the 3 stock run to 9 in two weeks jumped in at the peak and was shocked that the penny stock with no revenue dumped back down its a long term hold stock on the hopes that they generate revenue in 2026 after their factories open next year   had anyone actually thought through the logistics of having mass numbers of huge drones flying through the sky what happens when something goes wrong and a small car falls from the sky what about the noise pollution im not saying its impossible for drones to become a reality but i doubt it will be fast or easy  dude you must get in before the pump not in the middle  dont worry next time you wont make that mistake  by the way dont thank us you did it all by yourself  makes an investment decision based on redditors

how could you guys do this 2 me  op  it could always be worse 

thinking of the guy who pumped his 1 mm  inheritance from grandma into intc for it to drop 50 in 2 days and see its dividend cut by 66  wait the line doesnt always go up forever  yea buying a stock up over 100 in a month is always a great fomo move time to hodl buddy  on the flip side i did my first ever option  put 10k in an ibkr account to play with no  unfortunately i didnt yolo the whole 10k  i started of slowly with 1 call for january 17th total cost 104 dollars on tuesday and sold friday for 440 dollars 

beginners luck   the ceo walked away how is that anyone on this threads fault  you tell em op  i read about achr during the weekend and was going to buy it on monday but didnt since it is starting to go down after up for days  so i bought qmco instead it went down 35 in hours gifemotefree_emotes_packdownvote  buy low sell high that is the spartan law 

if its high there is no glory to be had only retreat surrender or death

spartans never retreat spartans never surrender  a good rule of thumb is that when it comes to anything that is mentioned on reddit its probably a pump and dump especially with stocks that are under the radar or being shortsqueezed  always do your own due diligence the posts that showoff gains are meant to persuade you into investing into stocks so that their gains become bigger  what collapse its up over 30 in under 2 weeks  op is the exit liquidity  youre not investing youre gambling go take a course on investing  the stock was on the roaring kitty sub as a short squeeze 

if youre not early and smart with these youll get rug pulled learn from it  lmfao this shit is where it was about 10 days ago it will be right back up within the next ten emotionstsk tsk tsk  well at least i was able to see that it was a major cluster fuck of an investment and exited with just 16 loss and didnt ride the shitstorm to a 30 loss which is still brutal since i invested more than i was ready to lose in a single coffee break 

a few weeks ago i asked for advise where to find good stocks all answers said read threads on reddit so i did

for you who wondering about my thesis yes id didnt deep dive into research ill admit that but i read the er report partially and saw they had half a billion in cash a lot of good things in the pipeline and really great stock climb recently that coupled with all the casino managers in this sub raving about the stock made me pull the trigger i dont think the stock value has anything to do with reality they never are with companies not making money so its really pointless to say its worth 5 dollar 10 dollar or 1 dollar as everyone says and knows its about growth trajectory and like i said to me it seemed like they are on a good path did i invest thinking i would get rich quick no did i invest thinking it would plummet certainly no i just thought it could be a good stock to hold long i didnt know it was this volatile my bad lessons learned  pump and dump  lmaoo air travel taxi maybe good if hold for another 100 years stay away from wsb  this one was obvious  lol you got yourself to blame for chasing  friday was the day to sell or pre market today if you had shares  looks like a garbage company not sure why youre surprised  your fault for falling for a pump n dump man  and then blame others same as sarcastically thanking people  someone has to be the bag holder  when there was like all over about gains this is easy time to gtfo  how has the trading bets sub ended up here  que beauty and the beast  the legend of bagholder vance  fun fact 5 days ago op was also complaining about how nvda ripped him a new one too lmaooo 


should follow for more plays to inverse  less than 5 trading days ago

you should be grateful for a quick death  true i shouldve bought and held more shares at 340 than selling when it hit 4 and buying in this morning on the drop lol bought some at 7 might hold idk  good opportunity to create a position or buy more

edit typo  lol exactly its been cooking like a lot of things we are overdue for a big pullback in the market  the increase in talk and posts about achr was my dd that its the right time to buy puts never saw my initial investment jump 30 in matter of seconds  leaps are the way evtols are going to change short haul aviation i missed the big run up but bought leaps today on the pullback  i bought some jan calls today about 80 into the drop around 725750 talk about catching a falling knife 

i feel pretty good about them though also picked up a couple thousand shares to play covered calls with  same this is a company thats worth investing in for the long haul i jumped in pre 5 and bought more today i also have leaps for 725  then you will end up bagholding   thanks for the exit liquiditysome hedge fund probably  if you werent already in it 36 months ago youre gonna be the bag holder  dont invest based on what reddit is discussing 

in fact often its best to inverse the plethora of uninformed and financiallyeconomically illiterate retail traders that are found online in forums such as these  yes i saw it being talked about 30 days ago  was nice run up  so unserious lmao  shouldve side climb  for a bit but definitely not forever  exactly  finally someone who is informed  that would make sense stlas about 200m deep into archer 150m direct investment and 50m of shares bought on the open market 

im also a stla investor and todays drop stinks but any change has to be good long term at a pe under 3 just surviving counts as outperformance  do you think this is a good time to open a position in archer at a discount  this i just dont understand people dumping insane amounts of their money into  checks my notes  flying cars  its totally fine if you got into like sub 5 dollar range but 10 bucks i was tempted to buy but held myself off the do have a full order book though  actually the probably works as follows

if op jumps in as he did then it will definitely too late and the stock will dump 

however if op simply observes to see if it dumps he knows that it is probably too late after all then it will continue growing 

this of course is modeled into a recursive function that ends up with a 100 probability into op holding bags  they have 6bil worth of orders rn after they pass the next stage though so theres definitely interest in what they do  also im not selling and actually adding to my position because its down on zero news  buy the dip and hold for the long term  the rumor is also that they plan to do an offering doesnt that also reduce the price  first new air classification in over 75 years  it is kind of a big deal  never go full regard  i had the same exact thought like is this a shit post guy has no appetite for risk if cant handle a down swing and hes jumping into pre rev companies da fuq  buy high sell low  bag holder club unite   i also put stop loss triggers for rklb and lunr  pretty sure its just wall street bots which flood the subreddits after its ran up lol  yeah i was in for 600 shares around the 298 price point and have been following their progress for a bit now i was going to be really excited to see 67 a share in 2025 i sold enough friday to get my initial money out because the price looked too good to be true and its a speculative stock 

my plan is the same to hold remaining shares for a while my family asked about buying this weekend and i told them please dont my only guess was that shorts may have been keeping it artificially low but those same shorts being squeezed last week were causing it to be artificially high but i also have no idea what im talking about  first yes there is a lot of risk here but also if you wait untl they have something closer to market then you are no longer buying at 57 you will be buying much much higher i have been buying archer from 3 and will continue to buy archer all through 2025 as long as the price stay sub 12  i absolutely disagree just visited uae and i grew up in the heart of silicon valley and visit la  nyc often it will start there and then continue outward avoiding congested freeways and travel to oil fields its going to start with the rich and then become more mainstream many of the silicon valley elite already fly between sfo and sjo
ridiculous but they do it  learning no no no blame randos on the internet for your great misfortune and move on to the next thread pumping some bs company

op has it  i mean i was over 100 returns on it until today soooo guess if you know what youre doing you can money on 0 rev companies  i am still hoping for rcat to make me more money they have a concrete path to increased revenue with their dod contract but i did set up a stop loss sell  roaring kitty sub
til that exists  the only thing to make this better now is that it reverses all of its losses and soars again this afternoon  rklb is a better option for speculative plays but if youre wanting to sleep well at night stick to revenue generating companies with at least 50 institutional ownership  dude this is not a normal stock joby too not normal theyre zero revenue early development speculative growth stocks expect insane volatility 

but i think the speculation dont look bad imagine a year from now one of these takes off in your city and lands on top of a building imagine the press the hype  i bought at 3  holding long  i didnt know it was this volatile

did the 50 in 3 days or 100 in 5 days not tip you off  that was my favorite part why did you guys let me kick myself in the nuts   its always easier to blame others but in this case people tout time in the market beats timing the market so much that its a lie if it wasnt then we wouldnt insult fomoers nor care about bag holders  i might just do that  thanks for the tip    jim cramer doesnt appreciate competition  of the market drops everytime you buy that just means you are an npc in the simulation  vtol is never fuckin happening on a commercial scale we can barely drive cars  said everyone that hyped evs in 2021  why would you buy options on a stock that wont be profitable for decades youre not betting on the company youre betting on how the market will act  joby is better than archer in basically every metric  warrants work pretty good  they dropped a bit more than the stock today but overall they are way further up  maybe but i never gamble more than i can lose this is a technology advance i believe in  its possible this is a high risk high reward bet and im in peace with that  thanks for the exit liquidity  some 24 year old guy who turned his 61 investment into 122  me selling my calls to op on friday after a 700 gain in 2 weeks   never even heard of achr until friday looked at the chart opened 10 puts at 95 for the 6th wish i held on longer sold at 21  bad habit of exiting a good trade to early  basically this id been holding it for several months already was happy with the jump last week doubled up my position on weds held over thanksgiving and sold friday am did not want to go into the weekend holding that bag

i still think its a company with a lot of upside though  thats not true i bought 2 weeks ago at 5 and sold today at 7 made 40 percent  actually have made the most by getting a pulse on what reddit is talking about but these trades are very short term they usually pump for a few weeks and then pullback significantly the issue is when youre joining the conversation weeks after the fact and the stock has already peaked or you think any of these are long term investments  always remember news follows the stock price  depends on your time horizon and intention  some people have actually done research and followed the progress companies like joby have made instead of going on reddit and saying misinformed and ignorant comments about emerging industries that have a real opportunity to change the global economy and also heavily reduce car traffic which is literally the worst thing on the planet for an infinite amount of reasons  i prefer the term electric helicopters thats basically what theyll be in the near term like helicopters but quieter cheaper to operate1 and arguablyhttpsspectrumieeeorgairtaxisaresafeaccordingtothemanufacturers2655317166 safer their range is shorter though so theyre not expected to replace choppers anytime soon instead specializing in areas like shuttle service 

1 sticker price is about the same for new craft were expecting somewhere in the 12m range used helicopters are readily available of course so itll be highend operations that take the plunge first expect to see instagram fauxbillionaires posing with their evtols within the next couple years  i put some money into it after reading the flying car technology can be used for military purposes which makes sense to me they also are into making electric planes  because when people say i read into it what they mean is they saw it on reddit and decided to fomo in lol  i talked to someone the other day who was telling me how ai will replace doctors in less then 10 years and if you dont invest in it now than youre going to be fucked there are people out there who drink the kool aid and never look back  yeah totatlly agree  i dont think this is a meme stock but i do think everyone got in around the same time due to reddit etc and some people are taking profits  id like to see where this goes  im invested but i wouldnt put my retirement money into it  are you just gonna ignore its up hundreds of percent on no news also  anytime someone says rumor they have no idea the people that decide that in a company would never start a rumor like that  irs hate this one simple trick  well i did the same as you i got out my initial investment when it hit 5  maybe maybe not

depends on what closer to market means to you and the factors surrounding the company  honestly think this bounces back not today but back to 9  joby already did a test launch in nyc i do see these things moving forward faa is already working with achr on a new category of aircraft i grew up in palo alto and know the insanity the freeways look like there now the tech bros there will pay for a taxi service to save them 45 minutes also uae insane money and both companies seem poised to enter market there growing new tech and a new market is never without issues 1980s and 90s were brutal in silicon valley gates saved applefrom bankruptcy this will happen just how and who will do it is tbd  as the old adage goes if you dont know who the sucker is at the table  time in the market beats timing the market applies to general investing in the broad sense not speculative yolo plays on a jetsons taxi company thats up 100 in the past month    itll be hot until the first celebrity or sportsball player catches a wind shear and gets splattered on a public street at which point the hype will go down

autonomous or human driven these are ultra light toy helicopters  theres a reason why life insurance isnt available for people who have helicopters and hang gliders and cliff diving as hobbies  honestly imo all the value of the vtol is about their military contracts and commercial use in stuff like surveying and certain types of cargo hauling

yes there is potential but that mass consumer adoption revolution propaganda that a lot of companies try to make is kind of a red flag to me  theyll be autonomous we already have autonomous swarm drones  its great seeing all the people sag evtols are the future sounds so familiar to the ev genomics and green energy bubble in 2021 leaps will go to 0 for many people buying them   leaps are a cheap asymmetrical play evs had no way to revolutionize cars the way evtols will their only 11 competitor is noisy and high maintenance helicopters  evtol has the potential to transform our lives  ev is just about lowering emissions evs compete with established ompanies  evotl has no competition not comparable  to be fair look at tesla  yes im betting on how the market will act what do you think you are doing  but id never go all in on options or bet what i dont want to or cant lose  some of my best investments were forward thinking the long game has served me well and i was able to retire before i was 50 because of it  its a speculative bet sometimes its too late to buy the stock by the time the company becomes profitable  bought calls in both  flying cars lol  i agree this does seem possible  it was a pump and dump  do that 15 more times and hell be a millionaire  i feel attacked but im 50  you shouldve sold on friday and made 80 s

my point was just thats its hard to get in  get out of these names that spike so quickly congrats on your gains  bought a week ago at 499 sold at 810  long term hold possibly take some profits but maintain a solid position if it pumps again  they still havent solved the hardest issue they are incompatible with most modern cities beyond replacing helicopters in their current role to replace say 20 of cars in nyc with evtol would require tearing down chunks of the city to build support infrastructure which will never happen  
have you heard of trains  like a drone that can lift a couple of people and set them down in the city  sounds like a trillion dollar idea  whats the tam on helicopters whats the market cap of helicopter companies and how many do they sell

helicopters just doesnt seem like a big market  of course this is a casino sir  its up on no news they are getting further in the faa very process and are nearing completion of their facility they also have a backlog of orders  i guess let me ask you what do you mean by closer to market  ev had to take time to build an entire infrastructure from the base up evtol doesnt   their only 11 competitor is noisy and high maintenance helicopters


and evtols arent noisy and high maintenance 


half the maintenance requirements are because of strict safety standards and half the noise is the rotors


evtols have a shopping list of issues that make them unsuitable for 90 of applications in the foreseeable future basically the only one they do have is a smaller landing area requirement  and safety the elite rich silicon valley bros want safety  if this tech isnt on the market in 6 months your leaps will go to 0  gifemotefree_emotes_packfacepalm  to be actually fair look at every pure ev play all are pennies on the dollar vs their ipo except tesla


nice cherry picking btw   i mean theyre the only ones profitable and even they almost went bankrupt  betting on the actual return to shareholders the company will produce the discounted value of future cash flows

i do not buy a stock unless i believe that if i held it for 30 yeas it would produce a return higher than the market  its called investing  i get that this is your opinion it was pretty clear from your earlier comment  yeah i made a reckless swing trade on rcat last week and made 25 if i had bought an hour later and sold an hour later than i did i wouldve made 40 if youre gonna gamble on volatile stocks you need to adopt the mindset that any profit is a big win  you are correct i did ask myself on friday if i should sell and i was like naww cant go down thay fast can it the answer is yes  its a niche product that hits a niche audience whoever thinks its the new tesla needs their heads evaluated


the whole value proposition is the first viable option to market which is still why im letting reddit come and go with this stock still well ahead  will be once paper hands move to the new wsb focus point  i will argue the which will never happen our current carcentric infrastructure is ridiculously unsustainable in so many ways economically socially environmentally etc we will have to do a complete overhaul of our infrastructure or everything is going to shit which is also a possibility 
anything that replaces cars even a tiny bit needs to be the future because cars are killing more people than war and polluting the environment more than fracking   they still havent gotten around to making them quieter  everyone has seen a small drone  now scale that up to plane size and think of all the noise  tell that to the american government let alone california where these companies are based trains are better i agree but when america spends trillions of dollars and dozens of years on trains that arent that fucking complicated to build i 1000 have faith that these companies will go farther than trains ever will in the inept country of america and just for the meme market hype and flying cars make money go brr    well does what sounds like normal business development justify a 200 rise on 0 revenue and a very generous market cap  i dont have a strong definition you can apply because its a mix of many things that give and take confidence in the companys ability to establish sustain itself and deliver value

i would look at say oklo and call it far away

achr is closer to the market

asts is even closer  lmao vertiports  im hoping you could help me out regarding the sources for those issues since you know where to look for the data already could you provide them thank you  most of the maintenance for a helicopter goes into the insanely high tolerance jet turbine and the other half of a helicopters noise also comes from that giant turbine ya goofball 


i dont care if you invest in evtols well see if these leaps print   rip kobe   i know this is rstocks but this level of ignorance is unacceptable   leaps by defnition are options that expire more than an year from current date

and i believe their factory in georgia is expected to start manufacturing this month or q1 2025  and old school i feel the flying taxi companies will be like tesla 

or

betamax vs vhs someone is going to gain market share and take the market  grew up in palo alto tesla was the only one on my radar  so did apple 1997 gates saved them  ok thats one way to do it  thisexactly  its called buying a stock now so you can sell it for more later  atleast sell and buy back in then man but you do you i guess its a good lesson for you to learn   sure but generally you do that by making cities more dense and relying more on public transit not by making them less dense and adding more lowcapacity transit when comparing autonomous electric rotarywing transit to autonomous electric car travel rotarywing transit is historically significantly more dangerous than car travel so it would follow this would hold with autonomous vehicles same with pollution of rotarywing vs car

it really doesnt make any sense as far as i can tell to replace anything besides current helicopter use cases with evtol  this isnt true joby boasts being silent and as someone who lives where joby tests i can confirm they are quiet but hey do your own research right that means do no research and go to reddit and say some misinformed comment lol  well considering that asts actually has satellites in space then yes they are closer but again the asts stock pricemarket cap reflects that they are actually closer to full commercialization of their product so if achr was at a similar point in terms of being closer to market then their market cap would be similar and that would mean a stock price 3x the current levels  i was being a little facetious while trying to make a point its also largely just built up from having a personal intrest over a period of time rather than any solid data to point to


the problem with evtols in the current incarnation is that they are assumed to be incredibly widespread compared to similar aircraft used for regular short distance commuting 


while they are likely less mechanically complex than aircraft like helicopters any sort of failure is going to result in more damage and less predictable damage than a groundbased vehicle add in the fact that they are expected to be somewhat ubiquitous in their operations areas its a lot more rolls of the will it failed this time dice the only way you can even hope to get around that is maintaining a strict safety inspection schedule like with a traditional aircraft


as to noise the other commenter is correct in that half the noise comes from the engines but rotors also generate a huge portion of it too as they constantly beat the air replacing the mechanical engine with an electric motor will cut it down substantially but to make something thats tolerably quiet youre going to have to look into more esoteric stuff things like toroidal propellers or other shapes or tuning each individual motor to spin at different speeds and then creating bespoke propellers for each one
___
other issues include things like


 traffic just because its in the air doesnt mean there wont be congestion especially if you want flying taxis


 traffic management now youve got all those flying cars how are you going to stop them flying into each other or constantly having to take evasive maneuvers saying ai or machine learning just isnt going to cut it there are also a whole list of other issues that can go here alone you also have to consider things like where they can fly over residential areas close to restricted airspace what is the minimum safe distance between other aircraft


 safety do you trust the average person to safely operate a vehicle 100 of the time now put them in control of one with more complicated controls and the potential to cause more damage people are also just stupid even taking the controls away and simply putting humans inside a flying box has the potential for something to go wrong


 security a flying car with controls might as well be selling a kamikaze missile to the public the risk of accidental disasters is bad imagine people intentionally causing them


 ground infrastructure what goes up must come down and it must come down somewhere suitable for a safe landing if you want useful transport that means massively expanding ground infrastructure even single point to point is going to need something to deal with all that congestion


___


the best usecases i can see right now are things like emergency services where a small aircraft that can legally commandeer usable landing sites or reach locations inaccessible via traditional methods like firefighting in a skyscraper would be useful otherwise its more of a novelty or for someone with the wealth and space to set up a dedicated landing site or two   let me know how it goes  i dont wanna stop you but i c got burned buying a leaps on icln and thinking about it for genomics it just also made so much sense unfortunately once the hype cycle is over its back to fundamentals and these companies simply dont generate any cash flow or dont have actual products on the market leaps go to 0 evtol no diff  cities counties states etc wont allow flying taxis this is all fantasy   lucid rivian nikola workhorse   do you have a link to a video of one without background music that demonstrates it being quiet  hopefully yep  do you live in silicon valley nyc or dubai they absolutely will and do allow helicopter taxis already 

the barrier of entry for piloting one safely looks to be leaps and bounds easier and safer than a helicopter more on the scale of a private airplane quieter faster greener and safer than a helicopter it allows transport to areas only accessible to helicopters now 

taxi isnt thier only application military oil field transport medical transport  frozen area transport aka alaska canada etc 

my fil owned a small private plane and would fly to visit us every weekend for breakfast instead of driving 1 hour 

my dad is a retired rocket scientist who worked at nasa and then in silicon valley his entire career i spent the weekend with him and we discussed the issues to adoption and the engineering challenges for the major and minor players he had some great insights 

and back to evs californias 1 selling car is a tesla our infrastructure is there and its not just teslas you see on the road its more and more evs 

so while im not saying this will be adopted completely like the jetsons promised us i believe they will be another transportation option in the near future 310 years  i have a friend who works at rivian it has some real promise he worked at tesla before the company culture there is incredible and the design has incredible promise i think next year they come out with a cheaper one 

personally i just bought an ev chevy bolt used with rebate and for cash if it lasts me 2 years it pencils out the same as my gas bill in ca after home charging if it lasts me 5 year it will cost me 13 of what i would have paid for gas and oil changes 90 of my friends have at least one hybrid or electric car california has always been on the cutting edge of technology and is creeping up on the 4th largest economy in the world we are currently 5th

i have seen some pretty incredible technology advances up close by growing up in palo alto the computer history museum is a whos who of my dads company he worked for and all of the friends parents companies 

arpanetto internet the silicon chip was invented 6 blocks from my childhood home pocket computers aka phones with more memory than the apple ii i had on my desk growing up i have seen incredible advances in my life time and i expect to see more i believe this will be one of the advance  silicon valley maybe dubai yes nyc and other large cities like chicago seattle or large chinese cities wont just not gonna happen they are going to have to sell it to the government aka military


amazon is having issues getting their drones to land packages in your backyard not because of the tech because the government is not allowing it thats diapers in unmanned drones now multiple the size by 50x and putting a person in it aint happening   what insights did your dad have  cool story bro about palo alto i grew up and worked in the washington state version up until 2 years ago in redmond


idk why you just gave me your life story in 5 paragraphs all i was pointing out is all of these stocks are down massively and how much of a bubble they were in there is other nonusa versions as well down massively nio for example   here are a few areas he think these will be adopted more quickly the lower skill entry for flying than a helicopter cheaper entry to purchase cheaper costs to operate 

he worked with military technology and thinks there is huge potential for them in that setting the military has been bouncing the idea around for years but technology and battery storage is finally catching up to the dreams of this type of air vehicle the quiet factor can also be a huge bonus in war zones 

big cities take off and landing rooftop to rooftop transport or rooftop to airports could be a big market for private sector taxis and medical responses there is already an infrastructure in many large cities for helicopters for this purpose these are faster minutes can save lives appear to be safer and are more cost effective to run and maintain

inaccessible areas without roadways or lack of airports or gas support vertical take off and landings and battery recharging capabilities is a huge bonus for these types of settings oil derricks in desserts off shore and far away spaces etc think alaska saudi arabia uae texas

disaster support when roadways etc are destroyed these can be a safer quicker snd cheaper way to get into an area for food water and emergency medical support example of the recent hurricane events in north carolina many private helicopters were the first responders throughout that region since these are faster and more manageable more can be accomplished in a shorter amount of time depending on flight time between charges againspeed can save lives 

rural medial care there are many care desserts around the usa that do not have quickly accessible hospitals hour or more drive times could be cut to 10 minutes these could be used as ambulances in these areas again
time saves lives think doctors without bordersworldwide 

flying cars or taxis for the rich elite who want to save time during commute  yep bubbles correct that doesnt mean the technology is worthless and wont amount to anything 

many of my best investments have ridden with me through bubbles im fairly good at the long game and i retired years before i hit 50 time in the market is always greater than timing the market",0.9843,1.0,1

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger retires,"httpstechcrunchcom20241202intelceopatgelsingerretires

intel has announced that ceo pat gelsinger has retired effective december 1 and stepped down from the companys board of directors
david zinsner and michelle johnston holthaus have been named interim coceos zinsner is executive vice president and chief financial officer and holthaus has been appointed to the newly created position of ceo of intel products a group that spans the companys client computing group data center and ai group network and edge group
",_hiddenscout,2024-12-02 19:11:42,674,222,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h4v7ko/intel_ceo_pat_gelsinger_retires/,,"pats reign at intelhttpsiimgurcomiqg7njmjpg  he was heralded as intels savior 4 years ago by reddit the biggest argument was he was an engineer rather than bean counter

intel stock halves under his tenure

then intel stock climbs 5 after he leaves  if i was still holding intc i would sell the news and take the 4 pop the ceo retiring just before the release of 18a is a very bad sign imo 18a was supposed to be intels return to being competitive gelsinger stepping aside before that point tells me that 18a may be underperforming or a total flop  all that startet with apple designing their own arm socs because intel was and is hot garbage and not good for notebooks and mobile devices 

intel had enough time since the warning from apple deserved where they are now  now theres a chance the dip wont dip anymore  nana loves this news finally intel will have a 20 day  retires

the fact that it happened before it was announced means in practice he got pushed out anything else is just pretty words intel board ran out of patience  pat hasnt done the greatest job but not the worst either intel was arguably fatally wounded before pat got the job which was an impossible task for anyone its like nokia it doesnt matter who leads the ship the death spiral was set in motion by idiots before pat who chose not to invest in gpu development turned down the request to make mobile chips for apple and clung onto x86 rather than innovate  dude destroyed bagholders laid off thousands of workers and put the company even more behind of the competition and was like peace i am out lol  13th and 14th gen intel chips  their top of the line are having issues where the chip requests too much voltage fries itself starts crashing machines with blue screens of death 

intel first ignored  then lied about it 

these chips are still being sold i bought one 2 weeks ago 

they released bios updates supposedly fixing it 

problem is  most dont realize you need to flash your bios for the fix doing that is not normally required when you build a pc also does not stop it from crashing if the damage is already done 

tried to rma through intel they wanted me to jump through a bunch of hoops for a chip we both know is a lemon 

ended up returning to newegg at least they understand intel put out bum chips 

always been an intel fanboy not anymore this hassle and subsequent lack of intel making it right have made me switch to amd  this guy destroyed vmware and intel and retires with an insane amount of money what a life  back to the bean counters  it says something the stock spiked up 58 on the news  nvidia should just buy intel at this point 34t company vs 100b company  yikes  i cant help but think he was pushed out or decided to sponge bob welp im gonna head out  cant be enjoyable to have lawyers and wallstreet screaming outside your door every second of your existence on the job with as big of a bureaucracyhttpsenwikipediaorgwikibureaucracy that intel has become it has to be a monumentus task to attempt to even get something changed  at this point intel is a machine inside a machine  no new hire is going to understand the entire history of intel and how everything works  intel is gonna die  that ship cant turn too late  good riddance doesnt solve their massive problems though  people have given up on this company not good  intel clearly has a culture problem that needs to be addressed on top of the technical issues  i watched a documentary several days ago describing how he planned to save intel by beating tsmc  what a mess this company is in and all while getting government money
where the f are all the brilliant minds in this company
this company needs some serious intervention  i just used the opportunity to part with a third of my int stock  so we now have two finance majors running a company that has been in the gutter stock wise for 20 years yea amd calls and intel puts out the wasoo  so thats why the stock is up today  i bailed when the board took a look at their dismal trajectory on tech and said lets hire an accountant to fix that

the fact they were losing business left and right helped as well as the chorus of people saying oh dont worry about this failure dont worry about that failure just remember how big intel is and was  they should make the guy who invested his grandmas money in intel the ceo hes at least one of the few people in the world who believe in intel  theyre going back to the 14nm node  he was suppose to be the chosen one yet he just too the money and bounced s

  
imo it appears intel being purchased by qualcomm is getting increasingly likely  nana would be proud  good thing intel got 8 billion of taxpayer money just let intel die or let them get bought out stop pouring money into this mismanaged company  just a rumor but i heard they are going to appoint barron trump as the ceo stock should pop 500 on the announcement also hulk hogan is being named as cmo  wow it is effective today  retires  he was always supposed to stay through the fab businss starting up and save the company  guess his work is finished and the company is saved  about 10 years too late  quick reminder that their stock shot up around 10 after they announced him as ceo now stock is down 50 and shoots 5 after he retires makes me smile  ok but do i buy or sell  seems like tsm will have monopoly on high end nodes for at least the next decade  only 63  yeah its a bit late hes going to get a nice golden parachute  finally he decided to look at right rear view mirror   trust me there can be worse  i feel  sundar or satya coming in for next ceo  does anyone think intels foundry pivot will work out  i wonder if the government had a say in this   the funding 78 billion just came days ago  good about time  thats what happens when you appoint a nutjob fundamentalist  pushed out is more like it bod was frustrated and the chips act money was glacial pace in coming  i heard he lost them 152b  i think that pat was brought in to clean up the mess of his predecessors to do so was very expensive and also happened during one of the biggest downturns in child and structural shift to gpus i am reluctant to say intels woes are all his fault  well now they can maybe really compete in ai and with amd  i hope the fabs start soon and they get that tasty govnment money  lets have elon take over as intels new ceo  deleted  inverse reddit  no one posting nana memes  that dude who yolod his grandmas money two hours before the stock tanked is probably happy about this  let that be a lesson to all stay away from intel  intel is cooked to a crisp   he did it for nana  he did it for nana  hes done plenty he took the stock price from 60 down to 25 that took a lot of work gotta give credit where credit is due  fixed ithttpsireddit8g2g3r49rg4e1png  religious wackos make terrible leaders now he can spend his days tweeting bible crap  like most ceos  it was gods plan  he should be judged by whether or not 18a succeeds and not the stock price under his tenure also he legally prevented intel from splitting from its foundries so its really ride or die time  but it will depend on his successor who knows if they gonna dive even more  nuance may be required 4 years ago intels biggest issue was the fact that it lost technology leadership pat helped them make a lot of progress on their tech roadmap 

but now they have 18a about to debut and still no customers now they need someone who can sell their foundry capacity they need more focus on their designs now too as those have had issues 

pat made mistakes in expanding capacity more aggressively than he could match with customers he had some bad product launches 

if intel 18a is ultimately successful then pats tenure was possibly successful in some really important respects setting them up for future success it could also be that he had a near impossible task by the time he took over  time will tell if he did a good job or not a company that size with that much rd will often have a lag of years from when investment in rd or facilities for rd was made and the expected payout 

im not following this stock closely but i understand its trading near book value which when you look at how close to ww3 we are seems fucking stupid considering the monumental demand for intel production that will create but what do i know

again i dont follow this company closely but its frequently the case that someone with amazing engineering insight comes into a role like this cleans house and sows the seeds of success then the person that takes over for them ends up taking all the credit for the harvest  only an engineer can get them out of the mess they are in a business person certainly cant get them out of it business people put them in this place in the first place

intel has a technology issue not an issue with how to save money  he was heralded as intels savior 4 years ago by reddit the market

ftfy

upon the announcement that he would join as the ceo intc share prices skyrocketed the general sentiment around him being chosen was that he would turn around the company it wasnt just crackpots on reddit  i thought he was good at vmware bought intel the day he became ceo then sold it the next day because i realised it was intel  intel stock halves under his tenure

he was appointed at the peak of covid tech hype a number of stocks in the industry are half of what they were then intel hasnt done stellar but youre not playing fair here  he was heralded as intels savior 4 years ago by reddit the biggest argument was he was an engineer rather than bean counter

most importantly he sent thoughts and prayers  it is pretty normal for people to be optimistic about new leadership  it is pretty difficult to tell how things will turn out  then tanks 10 when people digest the fact that he wasnt the problem and that intels just a dead company  dad dont forget to grab the milk on the way home  you couldnt say one bad thing about this guy 1 month ago without getting downvoted into oblivion  i fucked up today have some options that expire at the end of the month and i should have sold that shit in the middle of the day today  deleted  he retired  pretty clear he was fired doesnt necessarily mean the 18a is performing poorly just that gelsinger did  remindme 2 years  they just got a big influx of cash from the government though  not quite it had little to do with intels own chips 

the issue there was intel refusing to collaborate on design and manufacturing of the iphone cpu they didnt think the iphone would do enough sales to warrant the work on intels side 


tsmc took the deal and learned how to collaborate with chip design firms now intel is playing cach up  know exactly what you meant with this comment had a little chuckle  very few people understand above  this is why everyones trying to same pats faultnot his fault  it didnt matter who they brought in  he didnt say peace the board gave him a choice retire or be fired  yeah im surprised this problem did not get more press attention tbh awful response from intel theyre cooked  honest question what made you be a fanboy rather than chosing by performance when it comes to a cpu and pushing the industry forward  just happened to me too so frustrating now i have to wait 3 weeks without a pc  it is interesting what happened to vmware post gelsinger  broadcom wont be able to buy the scraps of intel like it did with vmware  he signed on at intel with a 115mil bonus he never lose anything  broadcom cleaned out the vmware house and are completely changing directionrebuilding their roadmap  gelsinger did a bad job managing resources both people and assets and defining a direction that would lead to growth

nbsp

intel seems to have been passed by  everyone and even an average ceo would have a very hard time making such a stodgy business a market leader or even competitive no reason to invest in intel when there are so many other more promising businesses

people that bet on the last place horse usually dont do that well  then it dropped massively  it says nothing the stock dropped 10 after  they werent allowed to buy arm theyre not gonna get intel  it would ruin nvdas financials  no need nvidia is cooking and will launch a cpu business next year  qcom should take it  apple should buy them lol

or microsoft  that dudes thesis was beyond dumb hoping that china would wreck taiwan just to pump his intel bags as if the global market would not take a massive collective shit if world war iii happens 

at least he didnt forget that he liked the stock  your last sentence is ridiculous intel is not being purchased by qualcomm or by anyone else  they did as of my knowledge they didnt qualify because the government was smart enough to make the condition that fabs shouldnt be just empty shells ie operational well intel didnt deliver so the 8b wont follow either  sounds about right  yesterday actually  no board forced him out and funny enough the chair of the board is a finance guy so no wonder  stock went back down after  onshore fabrication has yet to work so they have a steep hill to climb  he was pushed out  it takes 45 years for products to be developed in this industry  it really isnt his fault tho he had to fix huge systems and technical problems that have been at intel for more than a decade now cant blame that on him its like blaming the 2008 financial crisis on obama who was in office for barely a few months at that time those sort of colossal problems cant be fixed on such small time scales i do think that he has tried his best to orient the company on the right path tho  you and i could have done better and wed get the golden parachute too  hey  he created a buying opportunity   tips fedora  you are absolutely right blaming him for the stock price is like blaming the president for a shit economy due to covid shortsighted af  yea intc the stock was gonna be hurt because of the historical cyclical downturn on the horizon and the weight of all the poor decisions before him but there were debacles in his tenure as well dont forget  but now they have 18a about to debut and still no customers 

what makes you say that if nobody else they at least have the dod but likely do have others  didnt aws commit to them  the fact he got the boot now suggests there may be serious problems with the 18a plan  this comment makes me want to invest in intel lol  intel has a leadership and management issue for extra clarity an engineer bk is the reason theyre in this place having an engineer at the helm isnt even close to enough for intel to be successful  a business person can pull them out too but they would need to be clever enough to listen to several engineers and assist them in working out a working route


be the person who knows a talent and appreciate a talent use their strength and help with their weaknesses 

basically you dont need to be an engineer or business person you need to be a great leader who knows how to listen and how to pick between ideas of talents  use punctuation guy  intel stock 5y 55

  apple refused to use intel atom processors for the iphone because of power consumption and overall shitty performance and specs 

but also transition to arm for laptops and desktops was decades in planing because too hot running intel garbage chips 

httpsappleinsidercomarticles121106armbasedmacsseenasinevitablebutappleunlikelytoswitchanytimesoon  as they should this man put the company in the toilet  past experience never had a reason to switch before one of those  always did it this way  things  tell me about it have an amd 870 motherboard and a 9750x3d chip on the way never used amd before but this has made me switch  wait this is still an issue when their stock is failing youd think it would be crisis mode to keep the fanboys and heavy users happy  arm and intel do different things  definitely wouldnt issue 120b in equity which is 4 and buy intel and pay off their debts  i double checked and as far as i can tell theyre still getting about 8 billion which was cut from 85 billion 

intel is so poorly mismanaged they decided against using euv machines from asml ask yourself how stupid do you have to be to make a decision like that

httpsoldredditcomrstockscomments1buc2wwintel_discloses_7_billion_operating_loss_for  oh snap  dang for some dumb reason i really want to invest in intc and just want an excuse i wanted to since the august disaster i feel like they are going to struggle but they are still a dominant player with x86 processors and they should move past the recent problems with their processors that should help them stay afloat even with arm rising 

if they can actually pivot to the foundry business this could be a big turnaround can this thing actually go any lower its up 25 since their disastrous q2 earnings report just something id gamble with until their next er in january  he was pushed out by a board made up of idiots the chair of the board is the fmr head of ma at citi and watched citi get demolished by jp b of a and goldman problem with having a board led by finance idiots  and he didnt even stick around for one

they need to go back to leadership that understands rd

these guys did 

 19751987 gordon moore caltech chemistry phd
 19871997 andy grove berkeley chemical engineering phd 
 19972005 craig barrett stanford materials science phd

these guys didnt

  20052013 paul otellini just a mba
  20132019 brian krzanich just an undergrad degree
  20192021 bob swan just a mba
  20212024 pat gelsinger just a masters degree

tldr  they stopped being a tech company and became a finance and toobigtofaillobbying company

you can see that in their top management

note that this isnt unique to intel   it applies to all tech companies

hps a great history lesson for investors

 back when the individuals hewlett and packard both stanford electrical engineers were running the company it was doing great 
 same with when john young oregon state electrical engineer was ceo 
 still did well with lew platt cornell mechanical engineer as ceo
 then the place started falling apart when they put someone with an education in medieval history sadly not kidding here as ceo and its been finance people ever since continuing its downward spiral  bro it is his fault we are not blaming the first year on the guy its been 5 years at some point he needs to take responsibility also a company does not have 3 independent branches of government the man literally ran as a ruler of the entire company compare that to amd ceo lisa su the difference is night and day

he is literally at fault period intel new desktop cpu for both 13th and 14th gen crashes and replacements are under his supervision  ssshhhheeeeiiiitttt

he made the decision to ignore  then lie about the 13 and 14 gen chips not to mention they are still being sold right now  i dont really follow intel close enough to know what he has changed or the problems he inherited and im just a regard so if stock go up he good if stock go down he bad  oops seems like i offended you thanks for reminding me that this is reddit and all the snowflakes hang out here  i didnt mean literally no customers but they havent had enough sales of foundry capacity and they way overbuilt capacity and then had to delay plans etc microsoft contract is up to 15b dod is a few billion more but intel has spent 50b on foundry in the last two years alone they need way more sales of high end processes  the size of that deal was left very vague and probably conditional the numbers sound large but running a foundry is insanely expensive intel has invested 50 billion in the last couple years alone a few billion in sales to amazon the dod and microsoftare not going to cut it and those are multi year deals thats not a single year of revenue  yes multi billion dollar multi year deal on 18a  it more likely suggests that progress toward 18a is so far along that pat is no longer what is needed his biggest strength is not the biggest current issue of 18a is healthy  old ceo is source of all worlds problems

get new ceo

new ceo becomes source of all problems

why does the general public have so much trouble with this it is so easy and lazy to look at bad results and say shit ceo and good results and say good ceo when they only have so much control over it

i think the reason is that because its so hard to argue against something so lazy but easy to propagate and so it just becomes the accepted norm  id say youre spot on despite amds growth intel still has majority share in x86 space yet they keep posting massive quarterly losses how is that anything else but mismanagement  while i agree they have an overall they need better leadership an mbamarketing guy sunk intels ship a long time ago when pat was a simple engineer you need an engineer to turn this ship around  bk was never an engineer he was a chem major from sjsu in the early 80s back then if you had a heartbeat and could spell your name you got into sjsu he was a glorified fab manager who was good at playing politics he just rode the rising tide of predictable dennard scaling until 10nm when shit hit the fan in process dev the fab guy as ceo should have been the perfect guy for the job instead he was the one to f it up because he didnt really know shit about technology intel decided against using euv under bk 


 i swear hearing him talk in person about the spectre and meltdown bugs while he insider traded all his stock was cringe  he actually used throwing away a starbucks cup into the trash can as an analogy to the bug no doubt that dumb analogy was cooked up by his bain consultants   bk was a chemical engineer and office politician he climbed to the top of the greasy pole by aggressively embracing dei before the term was coined as is often the case with midwits he packed the senior benches with similar types  not even just those look at the semiconductor etf soxx literally could have just bought a general semiconductor etf and you would have outperformed theyre not just underperforming the indexes but all their peers as well bagholders will always be delusional  yes apple didnt want intel atom because it was too power hungry thats why they went to intel and proposed designing a new chip for the iphone which intel said no to because intel didnt think the iphone would sell well enough to justify work on their end 

so again it had little to do with intels own chips  the big mistake was when intel rejected collaborating on the iphone chip where tsmc took the offer  i see thank you for answering  yes yet theyre both sitting on massive market shares which is all that matters when it comes to approval of such transactions it would be monopolistic  not just debt nvdas strength is being a fabless design company taking over intel would drag all of their growth and profitability ratios down it would be like towing an anchor  my bad then i was naively wrong  x86 competition is fierce with amd having way better designs apple has proven they can develop a super perfomant and efficient consumer chip with a different isa  have a good chunk of software running on it part of their success comes from owning the whole development stack and setting the rules nvidia rumours of developing cpus will make it even harder for intel to compete in data centerclient

pat was betting the whole company mostly on foundry not products foundry is what has the best growth potential they have not been clear regarding how healthy 18a is unless pat has a serious personal issue its abrupt leave raises some questions the guy that was allin on 18a is leaving before seeing if the bet paid off foundries are not expected to properly work until eoy 20252026

the us government says it is super important to also fab bleeding edge chips inhouse considering how taiwan is keeping the best tech in their country tsmcs fabs in az wont really provide bleeding edge nodes in the us maybe samsungintel will but only one company has a proven bleeding edge tech and makes 90 of the most advanced chips in the world the other players are struggling and have yet to prove they have good yields and scalability

not financial advice but i would invest elsewhere  jesus christ calling pat gelsinger just a masters degree an excerpt from his wiki page

gelsinger was the lead architect of the 4th generation 80486 processor introduced in 1989 at age 32 he was named the youngest vice president in intels history mentored by intel ceo andrew grove gelsinger became the companys cto in 2001 leading key technology developments including wifi usb intel core and intel xeon processors and 14 chip projects

back in the 2000s when he led intel to worldwide dominance he used to be called kicking pat gelsinger by the tech tabloids now hes always been just someone with a masters degree  lmao acting like paul otellinis reign didnt produce innovation is some full on simple jack level understanding of the semiconductor world  why do you make mbas look better than just a masters degree most of the time mbas are essentially bought and even from the good universities they are not really on par with an actual masters which normally prepares you for a phd  cause having a phd automatically you a better person to lead a company than anyone else  yea because it is the school that defines people

lmao some people are so fucking delusional do you even have a degree  i can tell youre still in school because you think education matters once youve been in industry for 10 years  sadly engineers are undervalued in corporate america  and automotive and aviation  so what youre saying is engineers make great ceos thats music to my ears as im an engineer too not the imaginary kind  it took amd more than a decade almost 2 to regein any sort of parity or advantage with intel and you expect pat to somehow turn everything around in 35 years next gen fabs dont get built overnight not to mention that there have been a lot of people thag were simply not under his control and he had to navigate supply chain problems end of globalisationtrade wars

i am not saying he didnt make any mistakes because he did but overall the current situation is not on him  the truth is in the middle he did inherit a mess but also under his watch some big errors were made  i think its been 35 years  just fyi the amd turn around started around 2013 took solid 4 years for ryzen 1 architecture to hit retail  fair enough most honest redditor kind regards bro  so the strategy with intel allows to keep fabs running for many years they dont need to recoup 50b immediately  sales of the very chips that are bricking peoples machines 

good luck  same problem in politics lol the world is too complicated and people have attribution bias  satya nadella single handedlywas instrumental in turning microsoft around lisa su single handedlywas instrumental in turning amd around  thats how people are with everything

its no different then ancient egyptian blaming the pharaoh for crop failures and praising him for its success

that doesnt mean the top guy doesnt have some say in how things play out but people like to pin the results on complex system on one person  or maybe it was the ceo decision to ignore  then lie  and continue to sell up to today bum chips that brick machines  you are ignoring the point that intel still produced shit laptop chips if they had great laptop chips apple wouldnt have moved their laptop line away from intel  its funny how that works buying intel would give them something of substance actually worth more than what they have but in delulu stock world its bad  it would be like a cruise ship towing a 100lb anchor  what if they can buy the design part and not the foundry part   buying intel would be good for profitability because they wouldnt have to rely on tsmc to produce their future chips  thats what i was thinking you seem to know more about him then me but trying to put pat in with the 2 previous ceos is disingenuous af

and its funny how people shit on the the company being a financials company but then go on to rate pats time as ceo based off share price thats like the most mbaesque way to measure a company and these people are shitting on the mba culture of finance that has invaded intel by measuring the company like the most base level mediocre mba imaginable

god this sub has some of the most brainlet takes  i certainly didnt imply for them to look better

i thought i put them both in the bucket of

 undervalues research when contrasted with phds  yeahpeople seem to forget amd was a joke for a long time  yes it is simple facts amd decides to choose tsmc over their own fabs in mid 2015 proven to be better choice vs intel decision of choosing their own fab thinking they can out compete tsmc innovation also it literally took lisa su 1 year to reverse amd trajectory and revert to growth both in stocks and returns just look at their 10q and market valuation first year at 2014 she focused immediately on gaming data center and immersive platforms and chose tsmc lisa was appointed at oct of 2014 discounting 2015 in one year amd went from 4 billion revenue 2016 to 6 billion 2018

amd continued to choose tsmc with nvidia and apple vs intel this alone is the biggest blunder intel current ceo has made he did not have the technical expertise to execute even today 

amd reversal did not take 10 years that statement is unequivocally incorrect amd going from loss to growth was immediate intel went from growth to losses under the ceo leadership recent quarter revenue was down 6 percent intel ceo joined in 2021 by 2022 to 2023 revenue dropped to 54 billion same as 2011 projected revenue for 2024 is 52 billion lower than 2011  but it wasnt long after lisa su took the helm in 2014 that amd started to rocket from basically crawling halfdead on the ground she pivoted them towards going heavy on gpu technologies and heavily multithreaded architectures at a time when singlecore clocks were king they also started giving up on  their homegrown globalfoundries and ramped up deals with competitor tsmc for their highend nodes these risky decisions arguably got them basically teetering at the edge of bankruptcy at 4share to peaks of 200 early this year 

we got polaris rx 480 shortly after she became tech girl boss they soon started to glue together cores for their highend  cpus as intel used to joke but that lead them from crappy bulldozer to the goated zen architecture and now we have 192core monsters  like the amd epyc 9005

having the right person making the difficult decisions definitely can make all the difference  i didnt say they needed 50 billion immediately but announcing 20 billion of sales over many years through the end of the decade does not add up to being the second largest foundry in the world by the end of the decade not by a longshot  the seeds for azure were planted under ballmer  they didnt still attribution bias

they may have hired the right people and pushed investments to the right products and outcomes but everything a ceo does is rarely single handedly

do you take credit for everything your family does because well they are my kid so its like i did it or well i chose to married that so i accomplished it single handedly take that and multiply it by 10000x

or another example you double your sales quota and everyone on your team 15x your manager single handedly increased his regions sales by over 50 maybe he enabled you but maybe he got lucky to have a great team

the main difference is a leaders actions and choices and microactions have far reaching consequences often unintended consequences so your influence is important however single handedly is a lazy attribution that gets thrown around a lot  once apple started designing their own mobile chips in the early 2000s it was only a matter of time before they would scale it up to their laptops as well in their typical vertically integrated fashion looking at the development timeline of the ipad chips its very likely the apple silicon roadmap was already being discussed while steve jobs was alive and accelerated due to the failures of the touch bar era macbooks  they would have little later  sometimes less is more  why do you have that perspective the manufacturing is the outdated easier part of the process its akin to architecture versus framing should the framer on the construction site earn more than the architect in the office after all the architect is just designing and doesnt make anything

obviously it is much harder to design a house than to assemble it same with chips  chips act money prevents that  that is a big assumption which is probably false  they dont have to rely on tsmc currently either intel would be glad to get a piece of nvidias money and have their fabs making nvidia chips instead of tsmc

their fabs are just not nearly as advanced as tsmcs nvidia uses tsmc over intel by choice  there are too many people on reddit who believe that every leader of a tech company needs to be a phd engineer  those are great qualifications but its a joke to think thats the only group of people that can lead a tech company  just a masters degree and mba did feel like mba was not just something even though an mba is mostly laughed at while an actual masters is often a lot more valuable  yeah i expect intel to be in this position until at least the early 2030s stuff like this takes time  of course but you werent talking about them being the second largest foundry in the world you were talking about them making back the money they invested in the hardware  satya nadella picked the right people that is a skill in itself napoleon didnt manage every victory on the battlefield and in politics himself either he was crazy good at finding the right people and giving them the room to develop and use their skills

its kinda suprising you think single handedly is meant to be taken literally  wrong choice of word replace by instrumental  exactly see saas  the big selling point of a fab isnt necessarily just the ability to produce its the ability to aid design by adjusting andor creating a process that can house the design these consultations and codevelopments is what tsmc is so good at designing a specific transistor layout or transistor type within the capabilities of a process to enable a certain compute unit to be bult as example  
  
designing a house is the easy part making sure that design uses the right materials and is structurally sound is a whole other thing thats why over here you generally have a static engineer who does exactly that verify the structural integrity and material choices  
  
this is where intel now really took the loss they managed to fuck up the process part as a fab provider thats gonna be a huge lost of trust issue you can also see this with boeing its a loss of confidence which for investors generally is much more indicative too  what if there is only one single framer with the skillset to carry out the architects design where is the barrier to entry is it harder to train more framers or harder for architects to come up with new designs  its not a big assumption tsmc has been hiking prices and nvidia has historically relied on them intel actually owns fabs  intel has purchased all of asmls highna machines for 2024  would that not suggest that intels fabs will be better than tsmcs soon  had he stayed and they were able to execute their roadmap even somewhat successfully they wouldve been in a much better place by the end of the decade now its questionable if they will ever get there at all  i was talking about their over investment in capacity they couldnt sell they invested like that because of their goal to be the second largest they arent getting traction and that is my point its all related  thank you for this insight its even worse than i thought with that company  it is harder to train architects if there was one single framer then fire the project manager  there are still a ton of assumptions there nvda is a fabless company buying a major fab would be a huge risk they have basically no manufacturing expertise that is not their strength you also have to assume that intcs manufacturing will be able to catch tsmc which is hardly guaranteed  thats not how it works theres a lot more than just the machines to the manufectoring process patents experience experienced employees customers and partnerships etc  intel does not have the experience or resources but nvidia might",0.6249,0.9998,1

im going to look at stock patterns and the intraday option on finviz elite costs a subscription service is there a platform i can look at channel up stocks intraday let me know thanks  citron pounding the table that nbis is poised to be the next ai wall street darling a sleeper with no analyst coverage yet the market hasnt caught on to its massive potentialor its undervaluation vs coreweave if it trades at a 50 discount to coreweave multiple that puts nbis at 60  another day i regret not just longing nbis instead of selling puts oof  looking at rr rycey msft  meta even though 2 of the 3 had a massive run  do companies usually wait until the earnings period to announce a stock split or are they more random than that  avgo is up 91 since the start of the year  anyone have thoughts on potential tariffs imposed on canada and their effect on certain canadian industries ive been trying to figure out how onguard i should be my current stance is waitandsee what happens postinauguration but just wanted to get opinions from people in similar positions

thoughts i dont want to get to crazy cause thats where i see people lose money and really dont want to be like that  msft is developing an exceptionally strong technical squeeze setup near its 52week high theres compression in the daily and weekly timeframe volatility is decreasing and several emas are stacking together the ta is corroborated by a massive 32k call concentration 450 strike on december 20th expiration  need advice i caught the falling knife on both tmdx and nu only for it to fall further these are sub 1 positions so far but admittedly i didnt do any research before buying on twitter i read contrasting viewpoints could any holder tell me their point of view on these companies 

i am open to adding holding or tax loss harvesting on them  anyone here ever look at icici bank ticker is ibn 108b market cap so quite large i was looking around for india exposure at it seems interesting  psqh stock explodes 180 as trump jr joins board  thoughts on aspen bought it after a few people here hyped it and its now down 30

wondering if theres any hope for it or if i should just sell it as a tax harvest loss  app  this sub made me lose faith in the world how can a general public be so idiotic as you guys  removed  tsla is taking a decent drop today maybe a correction after the election hype  glad my big tech is now playing catch up seems like this market is acting sort of like it did at the end of 2016 after trump won the first time  ttd ps 28 app ps 26 thats wild my net at 23 ps makes me super nervous  klac is such an undervalued juggernaut of a company just raised the dividend by 17 on top of the massive buyback plan the world will always need semiconductor quality control  interesting that the market isnt really considering the revenue that pltr could lose as wars wind downlebanon ceasefire while tenuous is holding and likely not much left to do in gaza ukraine is a different story as its harder to envision an end to that war but obviously more likely with trump at the helm military is still a very big chunk of their revenue  cant wait for a new batch of rklb achr and pltr bag holders its 2021 all over again with fomo and rug pulls  everyone on wall street is expecting a rally this month on the assumption that underperforming money managers are just indiscriminatelyirresponsibly fomoing long to save their jobs fundamentals be damned

why is no one taking this opportunity to rug pull seems like the perfect time  surely a red day soon  nice to see it clean through 600  great isnt it  d

trimmed at 550 still own it overweight  wow  bubble can expand for a long time before it pops  if there continues to be booms and busts as quickly as there has been the last few years it makes sense that more people would eventually be able to identify the hallmarks of a bubble on the other hand there were people pointing to the shiller ratio 10 years ago and saying its at one of the higher points in history and predicting a crash based off of it people are using pretty much the same argument today most would agree that there is justification for valuations to increase somewhat over time with maturity of markets and increased certainty that some form of economic and technological progress will likely continue to be made comparing to historical valuations doesnt work in my opinion if we get a dramatic increase in valuations that is much higher than the average increase has been the last decades id be concerned it has been pretty rapid but so was the fall in 2022 and capital allocation on the whole now seems a fair bit more rational than it did then 

calling it a bubble is a pretty extreme term that i dont think applies right now it suggests fundamentals have gone out the window and people are expecting an everlasting rally there are little booms and busts and people getting carried away with certain names but this isnt the overall market sentiment  guidance  margin growth  south korea is just 3 companies though  south korea is not an emergent market my friend most emergent etfs dont hold sk 


edit i stand corrected  theyre both now hooking up too  i was one of those people making pltr threads on this sub in 20222023 i still make them on this sub from time to time so it is interesting see sentiment shift 

2 years ago for some reason there was limited push back at the bear cases when stock was 710 people just let the downvotes happen when people said pltr was the big ai play back then  i also bought shortly after ipo in my roth account that saved me because i dont really touch that account too much honestly i just forgot about it i would have probably sold for a loss in my trading account however i did fully exit my position just now at 71 as i cant justify the runup post trump election other than the promise of corruption if you still believe in this company there will absolutely be a better entry point in the future imo  congratulations great year for you  great work mate  i am up 8 today and 73 ytd not allowed to name my position cause it trades under 5 even though its mkt cap is over 1 billion _  qqqspy both green v confirmed  well yeah world war iii is already priced in  i love these vs are you not fully invested you gotta ride the bull to make money you get permission to point and laugh at me once this all goes to the shitters  switch 2 coming  earlier in the am on the actives list koru 3x s korea bull etf was down like 10  i saw why when i heard about the declaration of martial law  makes me think i should get some long term 4 year puts on the indexes in case someone tries to use the military here so they dont leave office   lets see they are growing profits yoy by a negative amount

fuck yeah 40 pe it is  if costco can be 1000 apple can be 300  subscription  service      where are all the clowns who sold august 5 cuz japanese yen lmaoo  so tesla is up 50 since the election because musk likes trumpfundamentals be damned  this was the first stock i thought of when trump was elected and of course i didnt bother to buy it  intel has to compete with an army of taiwanese engineers with infinity money and government support its impossible theyre done no leadership can overcome that market is trying to figure out the value of the parts when its sold for scraps  nice numbers and good guidance up 19 because were partying like its 2021  beautiful opened a position a couple of weeks ago pstg looking good too  wow a tech stock that hasnt actually eclipsed its 2021 peak i might actually want to nibble on some shares  im still trying to figure out why so many people will want to buy 1200 iphones because they have slightly more sophisticated versions of siri  im buying more mexicoeurope and beaten down sentiment usa  dont need emergency money im going to get a margin loan from my broker or do a box spread fully invested im riding this bull market to the top  stock not impressed  additional context is thats the identical result as last year so some are interpreting that as 0 acceleration  its also an isolation of data that doesnt account for sales that might be delayed or pulled forward and you know harveys job is to pump

personally if i could have 24 growth every year with no acceleration i wouldnt complain  but markets can be fickle and greedy  the bulls really thought liver transplant was the new ai  leave it to a jonah lupton stock to come crashing down who knew  citron run by known fraudster andrew left  that citron  where are you checking its 50  conspiracy theories and investing do not mix well add in some gambling addiction and you have superstonkand other similar communities  the management is willing to dilute anytime theres a crazy rally so itll never go to 1000  cult is going to cult  who cares  i only bought a bit in case rc makes a strong acquisition  i dont know what app does and at this point im too afraid to ask  cept theres high ups in the new administration that hate google and you know theyre a vengeful lot  gz man  do you know why it went up 8x within the space of about 3 weeks most of the big hype futuristic stuff that has pumped massively for little reason is dropping  theyre being shorted by a icrberg research  yahoo finance used to be good but now its complete garbage whoever did that redesign should be sent to siberia  its a relatively conservative strategy and probably fairly solid unlikely to beat the market by much and probably wont underperform is too badly either depending on how your bet on rklb goes buying heavily at this valuation doesnt make sense to me not sure it really counts as a lotto ticket stock anymore as i think the upside is fairly limited now it was trading about 35 and people were saying this fair enough but its already made such big gains since then at what point do you think it stops having those outsized returns potential  that would be cool msft has been treading water since early in the year  holders will tell you to hold or add obviously if you didnt do any research i would just sell  both are becoming interesting i would hold or buy more   i didnt do any research before buying

what a horrible thing to do  first its ok to make a mistake as long as you learn from it 

second estimate your fair value on each this can help sure up your conviction 

third if you dont have conviction sell 

fourth if you have conviction and its below fair value buy more

check out palantir lmao  wow didnt realize it was that high back in january 2023 app had a ps ratio around 15 i only have 6 shares left so i either leave it untouched or sell out entirely  its done terrible this year compared to voo  i would say the market is not considering pretty much anything right now besides fomo   pltr could lose as wars wind down

just think about all the applications when its turned on the american people  yeah i give it to mid feb 2025 at the most might not even be as long if we look back to 2017 except im not sure large caps will carry the load like then for another 20 year in fact i doubt that and even doubt a year with average gains  why are you wishing for others to lose money whether they made bad bets or not you just sound bitter  in on other words  you missed out on rklb and pltr  its a rug lifting at this point with pltr  if youre so confident why not short  because nothing can survive the v every attempt lower just forces a v so it ends up anyways  sure there are red days and green days  probably today  yup i watched it clear 600 back in october on a long car ride i wasnt driving but it was fun to watch it periodically shoot up

im glad to see it clear that hurdle  hearing that zuck is sucking up to the really bad tan that should help lol  bought at 118 in 2016 and some more at 188 in 2018 been holding ever since  according to some it can apparently expand for centuries or something  i mean im happy with it just surprised iirc people were concerned last q about a slowdown 1h of 2025 or something so perhaps this allays fears  msci says it is russell only changed it this year  i did and still do think its a good company however i did and still do think the valuation is way too stretched i moved into names i liked when i sold so im not too upset and honestly happy it panned out for my people less so my ex  thanks i honestly did not think i was going to do so well midway through since i had been very heavy china first 5 months but i had some lucky breaks as of late  insane numbers congrats man  surely people didnt just wake up and realize that theyve publicized their announcement plans for a while   that fact that people still think pe actually means anything is simply amazing to me  hey im a big time holder so im happy about it cant say i expected it to do this well in the past six months thougj  it can be 500 too dream big  yes i was buying that morning so i have good track of some of the numbers avgo did 29 since then amzn 38  paging avi6274

this isnt the ai youre looking for

but people are going to be dumbos

i used to kind of like dan ives but hearing him talk about the apple upgrade cycle makes me want to completely ignore any advice of his going forward

apple intelligence is just a friggin marketing gimmick we dont have ai yet i think chatgpt is lame 

im super excited about real ai but this isnt it  they will also need to pay for a chatgpt license whenever apples half baked integration doesnt suffice  what are your favorites of the mexico and usa  ive been liking brazil petrobas is a pretty great dividend stock and embraer is a growing company making some of the safest planes in the sky good stuff  how will you know when you get there    its a fairly valued stock now it does have the obvious tailwind that boomers are a massive generation and are all 6080 years old now should be solid demand over the next 20 years  me just curious  looked into their finances this weekend if there recent ability to make profit can stick or even expand with the use of ai theyre here to stay  yes lets all just buy apple and and tesla instead way better value vs google

s  the vp is also thiels puppet though  thanks i saw this on twitter a moment ago late to finding it too damn im just curious if everything said about how this company is scam is true that it  isnt a legit quantum computing company  scroll all the way to the bottom and you can change it back to classic  thats what i did  im really invested in rklb as i really do believe that one day not any time soon more like 35 years they can reach 100 bucks a share thats why i still consider it my lottery ticket 

and thanks for the comment what do you suggest to make my portfolio a bit more high risk high reward  true i wouldnt have mentioned it if the setup didnt look so good  thanks  i agree i admitted so 
was just seeking a word of advice  thank you those are reassuring guidelines for future  thats so discouraging i mentioned that this is a punt i took on a small sum and admitted that it might not have been the wisest decision so seeking advice about how to analyze these companies 

not all parts of the process are 100 perfect and mistakes happen that doesnt mean i should stop investing get the hell out of here with your sanctimony  its still a maga amazon wanna be w zero chance of competing  it had been around 2526 and they got that big loan approved for a new site in georgia i bought in on a dip to 22 now its at 14

im fine holding if theres a good long term thesis but if its gonna end up as a penny stock better to just get out  your words mean nothing to me  i made 500 on meta i made 500 on palantir my tesla average is under 150 i buy things when idiots like you are crying that the sky is falling thats how i make money and its going excellent  agreed still adding here though  because most of these investors just keep spamming everywhere how their beloved stock is the next tesla and is going to change the world plus they drag newbies with them and make them lose their money also its just really funny seeing the predictions that its still going to 3x after it has 4xed before hand just a bunch of idiots  wishing for others to lose money

wishing its going to happen i have seen 10 generations of investors come to forums reddit discord other social media get sucked for all their money and then leave

every few years when i think we could already collectively learn something from this there is always an ocean of next investors coming to lose it all again  ive sold rklb to them at 28 wdym  the other two arent lmao its a matter of time before it affects pltr too  do you know a first thing about shorting those premiums and risks are insane do you think its just for free oh i dont like this company so i short it 

i have seen people be few days wrong and lose 6 numbers in shorting not buying these stocks is already a great statement of their position  shorting irrationality is a great way to lose money plus i dont short because im not a ta wizard just a fundamentals type of a guy  let him suck i want money money  nice

i bought in at 322 never really looked back  its still undervalued  it can easily go to 650 and when it does im sure it will get rerated  damn the more you know consider me corrected

thanks for pointing that out

i swear vea holds korean equities  i was remember people selling nvda in apriljune 2023 over valuations issues i kinda learned from that to ignore it bull markets can go on for years so so this valuation  talk can keep happening as a stock goes up another 100 on you  if only i was using 100 of my account instead of having 55 of it in sgov  i guess the market likes the details theyve been releasing also the yen had been weakening again the past few months which helps  exactly pe is useless who cares about profits company are here to just moon forever so yolo retailers can make money  so what about other metrics like price to sales or price to book valueare those useless as well  now do tsla  uavi6274 most reliable market bottom indicator we have  they can make do recruiting people who otherwise would be making boba  whats the real ai its been two years any articles on what the real ai is when will we finally realize theres no ai   i used to kind of like dan ives but hearing him talk about the apple upgrade 

when and why  i dont think hes changed  mexico alsea walmex omab nu meli  although its not cheap

usa crox mgm lrcx mpwr  usually the bull throws you off  well i either figure it out or i crash and burn   im pretty sure hes said some positive things on lina khan


just because hes a tech guy doesnt mean he wont want to hurt google its just going to be for differing reasons although i dont know if whether itll be brought up


anyway you can be my guest and buy shares of google not you but the other posterits not really a stock you should buy calls on i would just be of full expectation it continues to lag the ndx badly until the case ends


suppose it gives you time to hammer every dip if you want to go glass half full  no  unless daddy gives them exemptions to tariffs amazon has to pay  so youre shilling a stock that was outperformed by an index fund by nearly 100 lol  i agree it is annoying the constant gains mentioning on whatever people have bought that happens to be going up and the trying to influence others on companies that have very weak fundamentals that have already rallied hard ill give you that i wish it could be against the rules here to brag about how much youve made on something sometimes it can be kind of toxic and adds nothing useful to a discussion  this 

and then some of them start to feel like they are smarter than you just and shove it down your throat 

lol boomer you dont know anything ai is the future pltr has unlimited growth and will be a 1 trillion  market cap company in 2 years plz go back to your boomer stocks warren buffet the old investing principles are dead and the new ones that im personally seeing as an enlightened gen z individual may be too complicated for you but i clearly see them    plus they drag newbies with them and make them lose their money 

why is this upvoted nobody dragged anybody into these stocks and nobody made them lose money  i dont take issue with assuming that people will lose money just the gleeful willing it on seemed unnecessary and little mean to me its well known that a lot of new investors make very poor choices and lose money  buying puts for mid 2025 is pretty safe if they think feb 2025 itll tank  welcome to the market no risk no reward  same after 2022 this feels really really good lol  im hoping for an eventual split but given the aggressive buy back it doesnt seem like that will happen anytime soon  you are not completely wrong one of the major index providers has had it as developed i cant seem to figure out which one it is though it looks like sp might be one  when you have unlimited money propping up equities at whatever price that is what matters  completely useless only good for an mba or finance course  real ai as in not just these lame ass llms

all we have is glorified autocomplete bots pretending to be legit ai

its laughable  he fully believes in this idea that everybody and their momma is going to run out and buy new iphones for apple intelligence

i dont know a single person that has even the slightest bit of interest in getting a new phone for this reason  thanks some homework at work  sure but at the same time depending on the ramifications of a potential google breakup that may have implications for other holdings that he may have im not buying calls either but i did buy stock  zoomed out to the 5 year view 300 return compared to the sps 9231 return what a meme comment  hes talking about the business youre talking about the stock movement

 with your logic youre only buying high  spot on with the fundamentals dont matter anymore ive seen this argument way too many times recently keep in mind im talking about recent investors not the ogs all of these companies started as a value play earlier this year  that guy said he cant wait to see the new bagholders and then said he feels bad for the newbies who became the bagholders  lol that guys just an asshole  your view of market reminds me more of a casino

investors diversify so much the risk levels are safe enough for them to build their wealth and retirements from investing

then we have shorting with a risk to lose infinite amount of money not just a certain sum going to 0 in what risk calculations does this make any sense though  just hang on and trim as necessary  i was way too overweight in it and it was a fortunate move but not smart for an investor  

others are flying meta should rip till christmas i think  ok so what do you look at when you analyze a stock besides past performance  theres nothing its either chatbots or imagevideo slop  o7 ian bezek was my main inspiration for mexico and he has some articles and podcasts out on various mexican names that i think are pretty good starting places  down 17 over the last 3 months while we are in the biggest bull cycle of a decade buy at the peak  its the redditor way  both obviously if you cant partition your funds by risk level then idk what to tell you i have safe money in walmart i also made a good  on achr puts  its basically my only position i have some nvda but not much and just recently bought some schd but the bulk of my portfolio is in meta

didnt panic in 2022 and have thought about diversifying but dont really know how

i mean i can buy and sell but other than maybe selling some and getting into some index funds i am at a loss

unless zuck comes out as a cannibal it always just seemed like a safe bet there are only so many way you can social media and if ai is the next big thing meta could shoot the moon  meli and caap have done well for me so definitely wouldnt mind looking into more  fucking reddit day traders man  three months is peanuts  always those chart startmongers ignoring the underlying company reminds me of the guy buying achr because the chart was pointing upwards",0.9648,1.0,1

semiconductors is highly relationship driven you best know there is favoritism between tsmnvdaamd due to their ceos smcis getting propped up by nvda as we speak

also having a taiwanese ceo will prolly attract more talent from taiwan who are the best at fabs  me im guarantee itll do no worse than  most important thing a time machine  so that he can warn that guys nana  strong  big and strong  like an ox  

but with soft gentle blue eyes you can get lost a lifetime within  who cares

its not worth risking your capital on them

and its certainly not worth your time exploring as an investment 

theyre dead money  at this point intel needs a dictator with vision drive lots of energy and the ability to focus that energy on fixing an entrenched company that is stuck in deep mud surrounded by quicksand

they need to come in and choose to be either a chip designer or a fab company not both

get rid of a lot of people that are slowing the company down get rid of the old company culture that put them where they are now any manager that has been there for 5 years or more

not an idiot who wasted his time sharing bible verses on social media instead of fixing intel

this person will need to be ruthless  young  engineer  who understands current market trends  a bankruptcy lawyer probably just kiddin ofc they need the chip equivalent of a larry culp at ge everything has to be rethought all the stakes in noncore businesses will have to get flogged to shore up the balance sheet so mobileye and altera first and foremost second a separation of the fabs and the design will probably have to be on the table again the manufacturing expansion will likely be scaled back dramatically the gelsinger plan was excessively ambitious from the start aiming to turn around both their manufacturing and design businesses at the same time i mean they should be happy if they can win one of those battles instead of both  they either need to focus on foundry or products they need to either compete with tsmc or nvidia one is much easier than the other fight a bear or an elephant its still a tough battle either way but i think with trump they have a better shot with foundry usa has too many designers asia has all the manufacturing  she should be a poc  lip bu tan mark this words  preferably one that doesnt let jesus take the wheel in the most greediest use of the term possible  id like to see them go back to the andy grove style again 

level headed visionary and just enough risk taking his leadership through the 80s helped define intel and in all honesty the entire silicon valley at the time in the early 80s  a time machine  im no expert but i hear the problem is with board members general managers and that departments dont work together the new ceo will need to have a heavy hand i guess  im more of an optimist on this whole fiasco  basically they are at a point where they can only go up  buried deep within that organization are people and technology that could do more for computing in the photonic and quantum realm than anyone out there

Super Micro Computer pops 15% after special committee finds no ‘evidence of misconduct’,"super micro computer surged more than 14 after a special committee ruled that it found no evidence of misconduct at the embattled ai server maker and appointed a new chief accounting officer

the evidence reviewed by the special committee did not raise any substantial concerns about the integrity of supermicros senior management or audit committee or their commitment to ensuring that the companys financial statements are materially accurate the company said in a release

super micro said its also currently searching for a new chief financial officer and looking to fill additional financial leadership positions the company appointed current vice president of finance and corporate controller kenneth cheung as its chief accounting officer

the news from super micro computer comes on the heels of a volatile year for the company shares sank in august after hindenburg research revealed a short position in the company saying that it found fresh evidence of accounting manipulation and the company delayed the release of its annual filing

those troubles continued with ernst  young resigning as the companys auditor in october due to concerns about the boards governance and independence shares are up about 30 this year after giving back much of its rally last month the company averted a potential delisting from the nasdaq following its monster plunge

among the findings the committee ruled that the conclusions reached by ernst  young in its resignation were not supported by the facts and that the firms audit committee exhibited appropriate independence and generally provided proper oversight

the special committee consisted of super micros board counsel from cooley llp and a team from forensic accounting firm secretariat advisors

but  the funniest fact comes from a now very big stockholder susquehanna their analysts shouted sell on every dog and pony show just to buy stock and call options on the cheap then not a week after the last sell recommendation susquehanna had to declare that it owns now more than 5 of the smci shares do what i say not what i do  all depends on bdo now  management are cowboys and push the lines but they have a massive amount of business and dominate with ai buyers  so many stocks why put any money into this  you do know the special committee was one 1 person  on the board of directors so theres no validity to her findings nor anyone that reviewed her work  its a farce  lolmy wife works with ey and their whole auditing process is no joke there is a reason why they are considered the big 4 i will put my money on ey than any shady wannabes  ahh the ol nothing to see here  is the special committee in the room with us now  haha i was losing money on this stock for awhile and im finally in the positive  fool me once  am i the only person that read super mario for the title of this  easy 100 profit in under a month when reddit and investor discussions are comically superficial and misguided and dont know whats going on and are clearly overreacting and repeating stuff someone else told them that doesnt actually make any sense to drive down the price massively its often become undervalued and is a great buying opportunity 99 of the discussion about them a month ago on here and everywhere online was garbage group think nonsense i wasnt the biggest believer in the company but felt pretty obvious everyone overreacted my point being less to gloat but more so to prod everyone who was wrong about them to reconsider their approach and how they ended up so wrong its so trivially easy to go question of fraud and accounting resignation  delisting and stock to 0 that a child could be taught that if youre not adding value well above and beyond that to make your predictions more accurate etc your analysis really is useless i know its reddit but still was shocked by how poor the quality of discussion and arguments around them were  we pump and dump and pump  need to keep the ai ponzi market going  sold way too early missed out on almost 2k gains but oh well  special committee is only one lady that is in smci board  yeah it was a group of their bods formed for a specific purpose do you have a point

httpsirsupermicrocomnewsnewsdetails2024supermicroannouncescompletionofreviewbyindependentspecialcommitteedefaultaspx  they have legal duty to report fraud if they have reasonable reason to believe it is taking place  agreed  very sketchy especially because they still havent cleaned up their earnings reporting issues yet and the dog ate my homework  yup thats exactly it i held on to my rather minimal stocks when this all came out looks like its time to sell  hell with the two big accounting firms that walked away  what do they know  the special committee did not consist of the board  it consisted of a person they brought on in august to lead the effort  a 25 year lawyer who specializes in business consulting  she brought on cooley llc and secretariat llc to perform the forensic auditinvestigation as a completely independent firewalled group from the actual bod

  
i mean do you even fucking read information about who they are what they investigated why and what the results were  it is all written down for you  you can literally just read it instead of just regurgitating the same bs over and over  fucking regards  interestingly ey in the uk had to resign as asdas auditor one of our top 4 supermarkets worth about 10bn i think because the senior partner in charge was banging the ceo  oh yes they do and they did with my company too but here very up the ladder there may be a reason hindenburg and ey are both private companies and very up at the top probably the interests align somehow

btw smci employs now the 5th biggest auditor  removed  a skeleton could be disorganized but not fraudulent  too much turmoil and drama could pay off if some things end up getting sorted out  doesnt give me a warm and fuzzy feeling  lmfao  tbh i bought a bunch of stock when it hit 20 cause people in here were so convinced it was going bankrupt used to work at a cloud company and have seen their servers before so i was familiar with the product sold most of everything today

inverse reddit is a viable strategy  its pathetic that hindenburg can do thisthey make a killing regardless of whether their report was rightshould be illegal  thats all its good for  mum  weve investigated ourselves and found no wrongdoing vibes is their point  usually they look the other way or send some 21 year old who has no idea what they are doing 

the due diligence performed by ey on wirecard was comical 

being dumped as a client when the bar is so absurdly low is very telling  ernst and young is one accounting firm not two  and people say accountants dont have game   exactly that was good reason  theres no conspiracy  if its disorganized ey would deploy an army of extra staff and bill tons of audit hours like theres no tomorrow  this happens in cases of minor fraud and accounting errors and isnt a major problem for an auditor  whatever is happening here was substantial enough for a big 4 auditor to voluntarily end their relationship with a high profile sp 500 company  the fact that smci is trying to sweep it under the rug is a major red flag  theyve been public of over a decade they arent new to public company reporting requirements and internal controls  itll be interesting to see how it plays out  is fraud really confirmed tho  i dont think hindenburg is the problem we are the problem ok those of us who sold

 supermicro says that independent committee found no problems they profit
 hindenburg says they falsified books and broke export laws they did already profit
 susquehanna makes their analysts fuck everybody who listens to them by issuing sell calls and buying the stock they profit today probably over a hundred millions again

hindenburg at least did put its money where its mouth was what susquehanna did is probably worse and they  probably made more money with it than hindenburg

now supermicro will profit in the future but only if what they said is true they are still worth less than half than before if they really sell their systems like hot cakes and they really have the best patents and liquid cooled systems and that systems really have such a good margin so fuck wall street those idiots can push and pull the stock price like crazy but at the end the business will decide what they are worth  if anything hindenburg brings transparency to the market by bringing new info to public and ensuring stock prices are reflected as such they just earn money off of it  buy more when it tanks if you believe in the company  then hindenburg reports are the greatest opportunity of a lifetime

instead youre complaining that it should be illegal other than throwing a tantrum because you likely got caught with your pants down when the stock tanked why should it be illegal  as someone whos a senior at one of these firms im in my mid 20s and have no idea what im doing half the time lol  do a little dd before you invest

deloitte  touche llp as smcis auditors until 2023 when ey took over httpswwwsecgovarchivesedgardata1375365000137536523000023smci20230309htm  what its called earnest and young thats 2 bro  im wondering if stickman was referring to hindenburg accidentally not an accounting firm but still relevant  or at least none that can be proven they are not stupid i suppose  agreed either they throw bodies at it or turn a blind eye ey has several spectacular cockups wirecard stagecoach 

to walk away is a huge red flag  no because both previous auditors dipped  except when they are totally wrong and a legitimate company gets pummeled because of it  if you swap the d and t you get teloitte and douche  no hes referencing deloitte  they are the other big 4 auditor who audited smci for over a decade until resigning in 2023  its unusual for an auditor to resign a job unless there are problems that the company is unwilling to resolve  if you look back at deloittes opinions they got ugly in the later years and were littered with critical audit matters for related party transactions and other issues  all these companies a well within their right to file suit against hindenburg  few ever do  what does that tell you  thats the point if a good company gets slandered their stock get pummeled for like a week and its back to all ok again no real harm to rhe company unless they really need to use the stock price for fund raising 

if hindenburg gets it wrong like twice they lose credibility and whatever they say wont matter anymore so there is no incentive for fraud  but companies can say whatever they want positively as long as they say our best estimate and its fine  thanks man i clearly need to do more reading about this place they should know that theyre really only good for pump and dump sadly i have a full time job that requires ot frequently and play around with this stuff to unwind so i dont get to really research hard and do many pump and dumps but once i heard about the shit that went down in 20172018 and read hindenburgs research eval i was completely disgusted ill look into the deloitte scandal

GM to sell stake in battery cell plant to joint venture partner for roughly $1 billion,"general motors plans to sell its stake in a 26 billion electric vehicle battery cell plant in michigan to its joint venture partner lg energy solution the automaker announced monday

the detroit carmaker said it expects to recoup its investment in the facility which a source familiar with the plans said is anticipated to be roughly 1 billion the sale is part of a nonbinding agreement between the two companies thats anticipated to close during the first quarter of next year gm said

the nearly completed 28 millionsquarefoot plant in lansing michigan was expected to be the third battery cell facility of the joint venture known as ultium cells llc following plants in ohio and tennessee that have already opened and are operational

the lansing plant was announced in january 2022 and the two companies first announced their joint venture five years ago

gms move comes as the automaker attempts to rightsize production of electric vehicles and confronts slowerthanexpected consumer demand it also comes amid uncertainty regarding federal incentives for manufacturing and purchasing evs in the us under presidentelect donald trump

the automaker said the sale does not impact its overall ownership stake in the joint venture or its future plans for a separate joint venture plant with lges rival samsung sdi

we believe we have the right cell and manufacturing capabilities in place to grow with the ev market in a capital efficient manner gm cfo paul jacobson said in a release when completed this transaction will also help lg energy solution meet demand by leveraging capacity thats nearly ready to come online and it will make gm even more efficient 

gm said the south korean battery supplier will have immediate access to the lansing facility to begin installation of equipment the plant which currently employs nearly 100 people was expected to begin operating by the end of this year

separate from the sale of its stake in the lansing facility gm on monday announced it will extend a 14year battery technology partnership with lges to include the development of an emerging type of battery cell called prismatic cells

prismatic cells are a flat rectangular shape with a rigid enclosure which allows for spaceefficient packaging within battery modules and packs gm said the cells are expected to reduce ev weights and costs while simplifying manufacturing by reducing the number of modules and mechanical components

were focused on optimizing our battery technology by developing the right battery chemistries and form factors to improve ev performance enhance safety and reduce costs by extending our partnership with lg energy solution were taking an important step towards these goals kurt kelty gm vice president of battery cell and pack said in a release

gm had previously said it planned to expand its battery cell technologies from its flat ultium pouches to include other forms such as prismatic cells

"""Existencial question"" about common stocks.","lets suppose that a few financial analysts have evaluated the intrinsic value of the shares of company x by intrinsic i mean not only the value of the company underlying assets tangible and intangible minus liabilities but also any other type of fundamental analysis by consensus the intrinsic value was estimated at 1 per share

however the market value is 070 in other words the stock is being sold at a discount is there any kind of arbitrage that forces the market price to converge towards the intrinsic value i havent yet found any reason that would encourage the increase in the market price beyond the usual speculation even if the stock has an intrinsic value of 1 shareholders cannot liquidate it outside the secondary market

arbitrage in derivatives markets is easier to understand suppose the market price of gold is m to secure this price in the future an investor can buy a gold call option at a price p strike price where m  p on the date of purchase of the option after some time the market price of gold is mn consequently the option has gained a value of n that is it can be sold directly for n to another investor even if there is no liquidity in the derivatives market to sell the option for n the investor can exercise the right to buy gold for p and sell the gold in the spot market for mn from this exercise he would obtain the same n

in the equity market i dont see a similar way for an investor to liquidate the intrinsic value of the stock it doesnt make much sense either so theres only speculation left if thats really the case its quite problematic as a famous economist said markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent",skwex,2024-12-04 04:59:18,0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h61ksu/existencial_question_about_common_stocks/,,"is there any kind of arbitrage that forces the market price to converge towards the intrinsic value

not unless you count dividends or share buybacks youll get paid by the company directly but the price can do whatever it wants

i dont see a similar way for an investor to liquidate the intrinsic value of the stock

youd see the way if you didnt ignore the one ultimate purpose of company stock for investors   i disagree with commenter below honestly if the true intrinsic value of a company was one dollar it would necessarily converge to that price as market participants spotted the bargain thats not speculative return either in the sense that a share is a certificate of ownership youd literally be buying a dollar later for 70 cents today essentially so long as people wish to find bargains price will eventually converge with intrinsic value the inability for individual shareholders to liquidate is almost irrelevant in part because there are players that can theoretically buy the entire company in full 

an addition to discount rate should be applied for partial ownership v full ownership of a company in some models  which is it besides being able to vote and speculating price appreciation what am i missing  even if investors spot bargains like the example of buying 1 dollar for 70 cents they cannot liquidate the shares intrinsic value right the certificate of ownership does not give the investor rights to sell  companys assets to redeemliquidate their shares simply theres no arbitrage mechanism available like the one we see with etfs and their nav

for that reason there must be another driving factor pushing the at discount market price to its intrinsic value since its not arbitrage then what remains is speculation right the prospect that a company will pay back in the form of dividends or buybacks and also hoping that someone will be willing to buy back at a higher price than i bought im not seeing anything else  dividends and share buybacks primarily the former as its a direct payment to you though in a decently efficient market they are both the same thing practically speaking a 10 reduction in outstanding shares all else being equal also results in a 10 higher stock price relative to where it wouldve been otherwise  right but not all companies pay dividends im also supposing that a shareholder cannot force a company to buyback at a higher price right  not all companies pay dividends now that doesnt change the fact that ultimately thats what their purpose is that is where your stock returns cash from the company

if it was known as a fact that a given company was never to pay out a dividend would never buy back any of its shares has zero or negative book value so that even in liquidation no cash would be returned and is never going to be acquired by a company not having these qualities its market value would be zero  that actually makes sense the traditional explanation that i see online is that a share represents a partial ownership of the company eg companys assets and earnings because of that i thought that the intrinsic value would be a minimum guaranteed by some sort of arbitragelike mechanism but it doesnt make sense for such a thing to exist shareholders cant simply demand a company to sell assets   
  
so following your reasoning if the current market cap is less than the original value generated during ipo that means that the market has less faith that the company will ever be able to pay dividends in the future right

so essentially besides any buybacks its all about dividends right   if the current market cap is less than the original value generated during ipo that means that the market has less faith that the company will ever be able to pay dividends in the future right

i dont quite understand the part i made bold edit if you just meant market cap at ipo i do get it now but effectively a lower market cap means that people expect lesser dividend payments in the future or a lower chance of there being any at all you got that on point

keep in mind though this future can be decades out look at amazon they havent returned any meaningful cash to shareholders ever since they went public but still they are worth 2t because the expectation is that they will at some point do that even if that point is another 20 years in the future  what i meant in the bold part was a market share price inferior to the intrinsic value the companys total assets and such divided by the number of outstanding shares i didnt understand how that could be even possible but indeed having less prospects of the company ever paying dividends is a good explanation

let me see if i got this right   
  
with bonds the value is in the coupon yield until the maturity date then i get the principal back  
  
with stocks the value is in the of dividend yield potentially forever when the company doesnt pay any dividends then the market price price speculation aside is all about dividend prospects well since selling the shares at the same price that i bought is not guaranteed the dividend cashflow will pay back the principal and potentially more is that the whole idea  yup thats it at least the way i had it taught to me and see it myself   thank you for clarifying your fellow stranger really appreciate it",0.9814,0.9991,1
Costco tariffs coming to a store near you! ,"i love costco the stores are awesome and they have everything but i feel the stock has gotten out of control

the pe is 59 you are paying 59 for every 1 they earn thats just irresponsible investing

they are expanding across asia but they are also facing stiff competition from home base chinese companies and one thing china is very good at copying everyone else and selling stuff for cheap to eliminate competition im not saying costco will fail but it wont be easy for them outside the us

lastly we have the tariff situation the proposition is a 10 tariff on chinese goods and a 60 tariff on chinese imports this is a bit of a problem because costco is the 12 importer in the us for 2024 most common origin is china walmart got smart and started to protect themselves and reducing chinese imports but costco and their business model will have a much harder time navigating with keeping the prices attractive

Anyone else buying the NU dip?,"ive been an investor in nu for a while now i firmly believe the market is panic selling because warren buffet sold 19 of his stake in the company

today the company is down again because citi bank downgraded its rating on nu to a sell

why do people care that citi bank downgraded to a sell its literally a bank that could potentially have to rival nu soon if they break into usa markets citi bank is just worried about a rapidly growing amazing company

if anything the downgrade should be seen as a good sign it shows that american banks like citi are starting to feel a bit of pressure from how fast nu has been able to expand its user base

i know brazil has made changes to its financial regulations however nu is rapidly expanding its user base to other countries plus brazils projected annual gdp growth per year is very good

do you guys agree


edit

thanks for all your thoughts ive realized there are a few key things i overlooked

i previously thought the stock was heavily owned by retail investors similar to sofis stock i naively assumed this because the stock is frequently discussed on social media due to this preconceived notion i believed the stock price would be significantly influenced by analyst ratings i still think a large number of people have started to sell because of warren buffett reducing his stake and citis sell recommendation however i now see that the primary factors driving this downturn are geopolitical and economic risks in brazil

my updated assessment is that the stock is being sold for a few very valid reasons firstly brazils inflation has been rising over the past few quarters secondly donald trump has threatened brics nations with 100 tariffs if they decide to create a currency to rival the us dollar thirdly warren buffett sold 19 of his stake in the company fourthly the value of brazils currency has been declining and recently hit historic lows compared to the us dollar finally brazils government spending was recently cut potentially signaling a slowdown in their economy

overall people are very concerned about the economic and geopolitical risks surrounding nu especially since it is a brazilian company brazil has a historically unstable economy and is currently facing economic headwinds that are amplified by the risk of potential tariffs

im taking a cautious approach from here on out i wont be selling any shares but i also wont be buying more until the stock price consolidates and the brazilian economy stabilizes

im still very bullish on nu because the company has grown unbelievably fast in just 11 years they survived brazils economic collapse in 20142016 and they also weathered the last round of us tariffs on brazil in 2018 i believe nu will continue to expand rapidly into other latin american countries which will reduce its exposure to brazilian tariffs and economic challenges the ceo and management team are extremely competent and i believe in their ability to navigate these challenges in the long term

the worstcase scenario would be if the brics nations successfully create a new currency even then i still believe nu will be okay due to its expansion into other markets for now im holding and remain very bullish on the business",Far_Version9387,2024-12-02 20:34:37,27,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h4wyxh/anyone_else_buying_the_nu_dip/,,"if youre focused on warren buffet and citi as the main drivers here you have no idea whats actually going on last week the brazilian government announced fiscal reforms that would cut spending and raise taxes brazilian stocks and their currency dropped across the board then over the weekend the incoming us president threatened brazil with a 100 tariff 



citi has nothing to do with this and its doubtful nu could pass the regulatory framework to operate in the us anyway even if it made changes to meet them theres a ton of competition in the fintech space here theyve won big in brazil because they were the first bank to offer usstyle online banking to that part of the world theres nothing that makes them special in the us  my cost basis is 12 so personally i am not adding but i will hold this company long term

its pretty evident they plan to grow beyond just banking products and if they manage to do so successfully the ceiling is very high for them  i dont think you should own nu if you can deal with the ups and downs of owning a company outside the united states  yes i love this stock and its extremely cheap at the moment for reasons that wont sustain long term as they will continue to beat expectations   nupe  nu will succeed long term due to low expense ratio vs competition and more importantly their obsession on a positive customer experience  you have to understand you are buying a company that operates in an underdeveloped market with a lot of economical troubles

imo nu is a sell today because delinquency rates and provisions will go up a lot in the short term 13 years

my reasons to think this

1 their clients are low income class c and d

2 brazil is in its way to a major crisis with current rates and government spending  why do people care that citi bank downgraded to a sell its literally a bank that could potentially have to rival nu soon if they break into usa markets citi bank is just worried about a rapidly growing amazing company

1 they dont analyst ratings basically just reflect market sentiment 

2 this is huge cope citi is not worried about nu first nu doesnt really compete in a lot of spaces with citi like investment banking or many services outside of basically consumer banking second customers at citi arent going to jump to nu the people who are banking with citi are doing so because of the name brandlegacyavailability nu does not compare in those areas nu is competing for customers from banks like ally if they come to the us not citijpmwf

if anything the downgrade should be seen as a good sign it shows that american banks like citi are starting to feel a bit of pressure from how fast nu has been able to expand its user base

hilarious lack of understanding about the banking market youre clearly investing in something you dont understand good luck gambling  i am a long term holder of nu stock and got in at an average point of 7 i have been slowly booking profit because in addition to everything discussed above something that has been a concern for me for a long time is the provisions for credit losses which are over 30 of the revenue over ttm that number stands at less than 10 for all other major banks in the region i expect losses from bad debt will only go higher when the currency weakens and would be a huge pain in the neck growth at any cost might not work for them in the future  is it good though  will an american bank buy nubank  i am i love nu even after being up 150 from my cost basis i continue to add to my position  nu way  why are people obsessed with this stock as opposed to meli which is a far superior business  nothing good happens under the 200 day average if its a great stock why is it going down personally im not interested in anything going down until its at least above the 200 day has the fundamental potential but technically its not acting right so its a pass for me for now  business is going to get eaten alive by trump and crypto over the next 4 years  my thesis is around them expanding into other latin american countries them being in us is not something i would have thought would be brought up in this topic

i am personally buying the nu and meli dip on this brazil news neither have to enter the us market to succeed imo  second this also the there is growing concerns about the slowing brazil fed interest rate cut 

nu has no moat in us its biggest competitor is meli  both aggressively expansion their fintech business in mexico 

its overall latin macro concerns drag down nu recently  what youre missing is that nubank is very popular among brazilians and mexicans and theres a huge community of both in the us they might not enter to compete with big players at first but they do have a path to it  in my opinion tarrifs on brazil wont affect nu i understand that brazils fiscal reforms have been the big driving force in this recent sell off but the stock would not fall nearly as bad if buffet hadnt sold

definitely a long shot that nu will compete with citi but i still think theyre worried about how fast nu has become a lead bank in brazil and how fast and successfully theyve expanded into other countries  its true that nubank nu faces macroeconomic challenges in brazil including the recently proposed fiscal reforms and currency volatility however shortterm volatility shouldnt overshadow its strategic position and scalability in latin america

nu has revolutionized banking in brazil by providing a lowcost digitalfirst experience to an underserved population unlike traditional banks it charges minimal fees which resonates deeply with its 80 million users

nus freemium model ensures a steady inflow of customers and its focus on crossselling premium products credit insurance and investments has been effective the company continues to grow its customer base and diversify its offerings which could mitigate economic headwinds over time

for the facts brazil remains one of the largest and most underbanked markets globally giving them a significant runway for growth despite shortterm economic challenges

while brazilian tariffs and fiscal reforms are real challenges they has demonstrated resilience by growing its user base during previous economic crises the company also operates in local currencies reducing the risk from us policy changes like tariffs

if youre investing with a multiyear horizon their ability to dominate underbanked markets and expand its ecosystem makes it a compelling growth story  if youre focused on warren buffet and citi as the main drivers here you have no idea whats actually going on last week the brazilian government announced fiscal reforms that would cut spending and raise taxes brazilian stocks and their currency dropped across the board then over the weekend the incoming us president threatened brazil with a 100 tariff 

for op if youre not keeping up with that countries politics in addition to that of the us you probably shouldnt be investing in these companies especially in a country thats so different and arguably less stable than the us  ive come to a similar conclusion i think nu will succeed in the long run at this point im playing it safe and holding until i hear some good news regarding brazils economy or the potential tariffs  why do you consider their value cheap  i fucking love reddit  why not are you waiting for a consolidation in stock price or some good news about the brazilian economy or is it just not a company you would typically invest into  why do you think delinquency rates will go up is that something youre assuming will happen as brazils economy worsens  i beg to differ on this nu is not going to be a competitor to citi and other big players in the financial sector at least in the short to midterm nu is barely consolidating its retail business in brazil colombia and mexico targeting a completely different group of clients compared to those citi serves citis analysis is based on earnings results that have been challenging but this company has significant potential in the long term it is just struggling right now due to political regulations in brazil and changing interest rates in colombia and mexico dont sweat  thank you for answering my question but dont be a know it all and say i have a lack of understanding i do understand the company and the sector this is just an opinion that i have you dont know everything if you think its gambling then take that up with warren buffet  what do you mean by growth at any cost their cost to serve has been stable over several quarters which is a part of why their margins have been expanding so much  i doubt it but who knows  nice im up almost 100 as well  interesting take i highly doubt that considering you can buy crypto on nubank  i agree and i still have my shares my comment was just pushing back on ops reasons for the drop trying to say there was some conspiracy with citigroup purposely downgrading because it was scared of future competition was just insane and a complete misunderstanding of how all this works i would bet they originally invested after seeing articles and videos that kept pointing out buffet was a shareholder add in the citi news and they worked backwards to a conclusion using the only info they knew made them completely correct about the panic selling but wayyyy off base about why it was happening  true that nu has no moat in usa but neither do most banks in my opinion  i agree i think theres potential but its definitely not something that is certain or something that will happen soon  just curious but why do you think a 100 tariff from brazils secondlargest trading partner would not affect nu  buffet sold when  im brazilian and what nubank has accomplished here is unprecedented in the world for a bank in 10y 56 of adults in the country have nubank and you cant go anywhere without spotting someone using their credit card the market is punishing them for not growing fast enough in mexico and colombia but growth is picking up quickly and theyre already making waves in those markets it took a few years for them to gain traction in brazil toothis isnt an overnight success story

whats even more important is their strategy starting with credit cards moving to checking accounts giving them access to cheap funding and then expanding into a full portfolio of productsinvestments loans insurance crypto and even a cell phone carrier

im confident theyre not stopping at brazil mexico and colombia i wouldnt be surprised if they announce expansion into new countries in 2025  because expected inflation is rising fast and the market is pricing in an increase in our rates to 15 a year

7 real rates

everytime we have a rate hike cycle the delinquency rates in our lower income banks rises fast

look at bradesco company similar demographic of clients and it is still sufering from the last rate hike cycle

things will be even worse now if the government doesnt cut spending  i beg to differ on this

you said this and then said a bunch of shit that lines up exactly with what i said andor doesnt address my points lol

nu having potential long term doesnt mean that its likely to compete with citi significantly in the long term because theyre targeting different customers 

nu is not a competitor to citi or other major us banks and nu being a bank is not influencing citis buysell recommendation besides nu stock selling off doesnt actually do anything to give citi an advantage in competing with nu so it was just poordumb analysis by op 

further nu is overvalued anyway theyre valued similarly to other banks with the same number of consumers but those competitors have much more profitable investment banking or services businesses nu does not offer those services  if you think its gambling then take that up with warren buffet

its gambling if you dont know what youre talking about pretty sure buffet knows the banking industry fairly well 

but dont be a know it all and say i have a lack of understanding

saying that nu is going to compete in the same space as citi and thats why theyre negative on nu reveals your level of understanding  you should look at their mexican and colombian operations mexicos interbank rate is 1074 and nu bank offers an annualized interest rate of 15 on deposits as of nov this year in colombia nubank offers 14 annual interest rates on savings accounts with daily interest deposits where the national bank has set an interest rate of 975 so yeahthats free money couple that with a high percentage of bad debt not sure if the numbers are higher for these two markets compared to brazil i would say there is a cost to growth which is not apparent  mobile first vs companies that had an app its the same thing now crypto first vs companies that allow crypto its in a big time headwind now sell any and all pops wait to buy major dips  because nus company wouldnt be directly impacted by the tariffs in your opinion will the tariffs affect the overall economy enough to affect nu  6 days ago it was reported that he sold 19 of his stake in nu since then theres been a lot of badscary news about brazils economy both these factors have caused the recent sell off in my opinion  its still 45 ytd so i wouldnt say this is any kid of punishment  good to know im planning on holding them long term my hope is that nu will become the biggest bank in all of south america its a long shot but their user growth is so amazing that i could see it happening  it seems that none of the brazilian bank stocks have gotten past their 20182020 highsplease correct me if i over looked any ive never noticed that before its very scary since the last time brazil got hit with tariffs was in 2018 and they were substantially less than the potential tariffs trump will impose

you have shown me the best bear evidence so far thank you for showing me that its very good to know

nu has a key difference from the other companies though nu is a fintech so they have barely any property unlike these more traditional banks

since nu is fully online and rapidly expanding to other countries do you think they could be different and survive high tariffs of 15 a year  nu is not a competitor to citi or other major us banks and nu being a bank is not influencing citis buysell recommendation

you cant say for sure that nu being a bank isnt influencing their decision theres been countless times that a company or analysts buysell recommendation has had ulterior motives  whatever makes you happy bro i specifically disagree with your statement its literally a bank that could potentially have to rival nu soon if they break into usa markets thats not going to happen it would be suicidal for a latin american bank to try entering the us market with literally hundreds of banks in place its a nonsense but hey its a free worldyou can believe what you want  i never said nu is going to compete i said that citi and other american banks might be getting nervous from nus rapid and successful expansion you can have your opinion but learn how to read first  i think they absolutely would the issue is that this would be a targeted tariff for a specific country not a universal one against all imports when the us previously targeted china us companies mostly just shifted trade to places like vietnam and india the same thing would happen here what percentage of products does the us get from brazil that no other country in southcentral america can offer

brazils economy is also doing well but its still not on a completely stable footing the initial shock of tariffs would put a lot of pressure on it companies will take a defensive posture stocks will likely take a downturn banks will be more selective about lending etc its true tariffs dont specifically target banks the problem is that banks are part of the overall economy using customers deposits to make investments is how they make money the vast majority of nus customers are in brazil expansion in columbia and mexico would not be enough to keep it immune from the factors influencing the finances of most of its customers  its 25 down after a great er  
although we had buffet selling  some brazilian political gibberish affecting it as well  it already is the biggest bank in south america in valuation and one of the biggest in terms of number of customers its also the biggest fintech outside of asia

its also the biggest issuer of credit card even with 100mm customers adding over 1mm per month

its not the biggest bank in brazil only because there is a government owned bank that people are forced to be a customer for a number of reasons  itaú and banco do brasil are higher than they were in 2019s high

the main problem with their performance was not the bank itself but higher interest rates that pushed valuations lower

itaús clients are of a higher networth on average and banco do brasil is heavily invested in agriculture most of our farmers take credit only with banco do brasil

santander and bradesco are a different story a lot of delinquency rates and provisions for bad debt

you are right about nu having fewer costs than bradesco and other banks but nu valuation is also way more expensive and with a more difficult and less obvious path for growth

nubanks clients are the basis of the piramid here in brazil we commonly say its the bank of interns and poor people

with that said i think its a great business long term but i think it may see a major decline in price next year

intr is way less expensive and is growing fast i have them as my favourites  it isnt influencing their decision because theyre not competitors 

itd be like saying p66 is competing with eog because theyre both in oil and gas or ferrari is a competitor to byd or walmart is a competitor to gucci

theyre in the same broad industry but do not compete with each other because they have different target customers  not trying to wade into you guys fight but i am going to point out that he was quoting op there the statement is grayed out after a little line and the two numbers are his points pushing back on it 

if youre on your phone or a thirdparty reddit thing the formatting might not be coming through but you guys actually are making a lot of the same points  you said nu was going to be a rival to citi in your initial comment 

you can have your opinion but learn how to read first

you should read your own comment

also why the hell do you think that citi would be nervous about their rapid expansion in the us if theyre not competing with citi is citi worried about all companies who dont compete with them id love to hear your logic for that lmao  also correct me if im wrong the 100 tariff only gets emplaced if the brics nations create a new currency

is it just a foregone conclusion that brics will make a currency to compete with the us dollar  yeah youre right im invested in them long term so im hoping that theyre able to expand out of brazil more significantly i think nu can overcome the tariffs and they will be okay in at most 4 years do you think the tariffs and other financial concerns in brazil will affect the company long term  do you think nu will one day be used in all of the countries in south america  agreed thats why i preferred to highlight in quotation marks what i was referring to in particular  show me where i said that citi was going to be a rival to nu 

i simply think people shouldnt care what citi has to say since its just an analysts opinion and theyre in the same industry

i guess citis rating isnt a reason for their drop i just assumed it was a reason since the stock is commonly talked about on social media i thought the stock was owned primarily by retail investors  argentina uruguay and chile for sure its just a matter of time imo  
they even have a tech hub in argentina and a entity in uruguay 

i wouldnt say all south america because we have shit countries like venezuela  why do people care that citi bank downgraded to a sell its literally a bank that could potentially have to rival nu soon if they break into usa markets citi bank is just worried about a rapidly growing amazing company

there you go  good to know  how popular are their other products outside of banking they dont actually get specific numbers in their earnings

for example with the cell phone carrier that just launched do you think its likely that gets strong traction  buddy do you not know what potentially means buy a dictionary or maybe ask ai for some help with english  the other banking products besides credit cards are growing quickly especially lending and investments

as for nucell its hard to say for sure since it was just launched the pricing isnt the most competitive but the appeal lies in their excellent customer support theyre using incumbent infrastructure so the signal and network quality wont be better than what we already have however their customer service will stand out and we brazilians are fed up with the poor service provided by telecom companiesjust like we were with banks before nubank honestly i dont think its a moonshot though",0.9732,0.9997,1
Is anyone else a little concerned about this market jump up?,"listen i get that it seems like clear skies and rainbows and im not really a bearish type investor but sometimes i find it good practice to sit back for a moment and just reevaluate the current situation were in

ill give an example that pertains to me im currently invested in sofi pltr and rklb so this has been an incredible year for me but looking back its starting to really feel like total and utter exuberance again like 2021 youtube videos and subreddits have been saying over and over how this is only the beginning and were going to be at 500 next year thats exactly the type of shit that was said in 2021 right before every small cap stock tanked like 70 

im not saying its a time to sell i would personally prescribe to the its time to slow down on how much i invest currently buying rklb at 27 or pltr at 66 is not the same opportunity as in the 47 range as it used to be it seems very difficult to find any good deals considering literally almost every sector in the stock market is just going up vertically and just remember just it is a great company doesnt always mean its currently a good price to buy it sometimes its good to take the foot off the breaks when stocks going up 300 in one year

but hey what do i know just be careful out there folks and dont get sucked too hard into the fomo be fearful when everyone else is greedy and all that jazz",Glandryth,2024-12-01 23:54:14,524,458,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h49py3/is_anyone_else_a_little_concerned_about_this/,,"dont listen to me i sold out of pltr at 36 because i thought it was getting overvalued  agree w op about the concern feel like you cant go wrong taking some profit  i dont understand the all cash mentality but think cash on hand will prove very useful  things like pltr in particular seem very toppy parabolic moves are often followed by big drops  im reminded that when there was a bad drought in the southwest that beef prices would get very expensive so they shorted cattle futures and were crushed  what happened was the drought caused people with cattle sent them to the slaughter house before the drought could kill them off  

the people selling were right but acted too soon

i suspect that phenomena is happening now  people assume trumps tariffs will cause inflation threats of trade war counter threats etc  the kind of chaos that hurts the market  yet instead of the market going down its going up because trumps not president yet  his policies are not yet unleashed and many businesses and the general public are stocking up now in case  

so im slowly moving towards more cash position and may get some protective puts when the market starts slipping  ive liquidated my tech stocks and have increased my cash position to 25 of my taxable portfolio

shiller pe is very high right now and im actually expecting inflation to tick back up slightly and spook the markets  i probably wouldnt ask for advice on any of those three on reddit the bulls will make claims that arent grounded in anything driven by actual financials while the bears will act like the companies have no value at all 

all ill say is in recent years ive had the luck to buy early into two companies that spiked incredibly celh  then tmdx both companies i made sells after seeing multiples returned on my investment and both companies continued to go significantly higher than my sell basis they continued to outperform i regretted selling not because it wasnt the rational choice rather because of market movements i should say they outperformed until they didnt and both today sit below the selling points that i once had regrets about

the market is funny in the short term and continuedlinear outperformance of individual companies rarely happens over the medium term  i expect a pullback but there are still good opportunities in the market i recently took some profits from nvda and pltr and quickly deployed that money into klac asml mksi ter and mpwr  i feel the constant menace of tariffs is not being considered 25 on canadian lumber would basically cripple home construction paired with loss of cheap labour with deportation now 100 tariffs on china goods how can the music keep going  you can follow the big boys eg warren buffet

lots of signs being there  the best thing you can ever do with an investment is preserve capital  the next best is to beat inflation  personally i have 30 in sgov but im also planning on retiring in a few years

if the market crashes

10  i will rebalance to 8020  stocksgov

20  i will rebalance to 9010

30  i will rebalance to 100 stock

i wont be hunting the bottom 4050 drop but will start buying once it crashes 10  certain parts of the market are frothy because of the election and large cap techai now is the time to start finding the companies that are undervalued and leveraging ai to see better bottom lines and beat previous quarters 

large caps are most certainly at high valuations that are not sustainable to continue beating expectations seeing this with nvda and dell most recently 

undervalued sectors on my radar are quantum computing and robotics emerging markets will benefit from decrease in interest rates if that continues and innovative technologies like i mentioned above will come to market faster with increased funding and the help of artificial intelligence tools at large

having fiat on hand to scoop up these positions is paramount  i also stopped buying but not because of the market gains the market is mostly always going up and thats exactly what we want im waiting until end of january for trump to settle in and see what changes thats the only uncertainty i currently have  ive been investing since the late 80s and to me this market feels ripe for a significant correction ive upped my cash position to 25 with everything else in broad index funds with a mind to dca once a major correction happens  no one knows when the corrections will come but diversity in a wide variety of the market is what im adjusting for  december will be adjusting for taking gains and moving to cash january for taking a breather and dd on new tech and how ai is playing out for the majors and minors  

i think its going to be a more cautious year for people like me  i have solid etfs for the bulk of my money and i have a very diverse stock portfolio that is up 77 percent as of today but that could change rapidly if irrational exuberance overtakes my conservative approach  the signs are there that were a bloated tick ready to pop  i agree  look at all these meme coins rocketing up everyday  this isnt normal or rational  at some point there will be massive payback but we dont know when  yep pe shiller is really high right now  ok go buy bonds  its feeling like 2007 for you younger kiddos 2008 wasnt a surprise there were a few people sounding the alarm but the market was blowing up postdotcom boom and it was like a deer in the headlights 

is it the same today the market hasnt been rational in years so its much harder to gauge ifwhen the next crash happens esp as the trump administration steps in with more drastic policies in the ready eg tariffs tax breaks political policies etc 

tldr who knows  not everything is frothy apple and microsoft gains have been extremely conservative this year compared to the rest of the market  totally agree 

were so toppy

just look at all the gains in another sub

look at the buffet moves

look at all the insider selling

look at stuff like pltr 60x earnings  time to selling near atm covered calls  im lightening up on all of my stock investments im mostly concerned about the major changes that will be happening once trump takes office and i dont think the market has even started digesting that yet the pharma and food industries are in rfks crosshairs and the entire federal government is at risk for a major realignment and huge reductions in employeescontractors

i also predict home prices are going to drop significantly in the counties surrounding washington dc  you know there are people from the 2008 crash that pulled out when the market started climbing in 2009 since it was to them just a dead cat bounce and theyve been waiting for the right pull back for 15 years now  buy more rocket lab  signs are all around you  meme coins buffet gdp ratio layoffs target weak earnings  of high valuations retail euphoria and fundamentals getting weaker this is the time to quietly take profits anyone who is buying low quality stocks here will be bag holding them for years  i dunno man when everyone worries about a crash is when the market keeps moving up  im probably going to cash out this next month sit it in dividends and wait for a huge dip to buy again but thats just my best guess i could miss out  very concerned  you only feel like this because of what you hold and how long you have held it the companys you mention were depressed and didnt do a lot under the rate raising inflationary market now rates are being lifted inflation is easing and a new administration is coming in thats likely to rollback regulations smart money is flowing back into growth small caps etc if you believe in what youre holding just hold worrying about if weve run too far and cutting your winners short is a sure fire way to end up with mediocre gains its early days for rklb where do you think it will be in five years 

im guess what im saying is its a nuanced big picture thing zoom out and look around you at whats happening elsewhere  yes definitely a lot of exuberance and young guys posting their gains thinking they have cracked the code id stay away from all the meme type wsb tickers and stick to good companies  the problem with going all cash or liquidating your position is  if youre wrong and the market continues to rise youve no way of reentering the market without accepting the opportunity cost 

a good way to capitalize on your hunch is to hedge your bet perhaps buy a call whilst liquidating your position or set a stop loss so when the ball eventually falls your position is liquidated automatically  im so terrified but what can we do i can move money to the sideline and miss out on big gains or just keep letting it run up and take my medicine when the correction comes  jesus christ every fucking day with these posts  i think everyone should follow the golden rule of not investing what you cant lose without it impacting your life 

although this ai boom is similar to the expansion of computers internet cell phones etc a new gold rush  there is an explosion of ingenuity happening and profits to be made i dont see it slowing down anytime soon  lots of people were scared of kamala being president she ran on taxing unrealized gains imagine being you with 100000 on positive growth in your account and then all of the sudden you get a tax bill for that this had lots of people sitting on cash trump becoming president elect resulted in cash pouring into the market overnight resulting in a continuation of this rally  yes completely agree in fact the market currently feels so exuberant at the moment that i want nothing to do with it im mostly on the sidelines in cash

i know that its irrational to pull out almost completely but it just doesnt feel right to stay in whats been going on at tsla mstr umac drug etc is too excessive and playing along right now would feel like supporting the emerging oligarchy in a country i love so ive come to terms with possibly missing out on a few  of upside over the next few weeks or months

i will get back in with half of my cash if there is a smaller pullback in the course of the next two weeks which seems likely to me and even then ill aim for global diversification if no pullback happens i will wait it out until feb or mar and reevaluate the situation then  money is getting devalued people realizing that the stock market is the reflection of our collective input hence the name stock so by participating in the market everyone takes a share of their input in a momentum defined cash and then we see a differences in collective skills of these companies so even a slight advantage will multiply throughout higher cash flow equals a greater growth trajectory and as long as the product stays competitive people will keep bringing money so its up to the employees participating in it to make it worth something thats why tech attracts top talent and gets paid handsomly infinite value creation just need to bet on a winning team  buy defense contractor stocks shits about to hit the fan  take profits and go buy some bonds or put in the bank  if you are concerned  everyone is concerned and cautious at the moment that is why markets are continuing to go up when everyone gets comfortable with the market thats when we crash  i have definitely moved away from some of riskier positions selling half my asts when i got in at 3 and moving away from some ai like armtsm grabbed some puts to hedge my sofi shares i wont be selling my walmart apple amazon etc and will keep looking for good swing trading opportunities like adsk snowflake flnc etc  i thought the market was i a downturn  you made a huge mistake back in 20212022 a lot of companies earnings were drastically dropping or slowing down thats why a lot of companies were selling off this year its not to be seen at all thats why stocks are blasting  agreed  im just waiting for some of my top performing holdings to make it to 1 year then i want to sell 50 and hold cash for an overall dip or a dip on some companies i like  just hope a crash doesnt happen til feb  absolutely
euphoria is great and all but the system is supposed to even out every now and then so keep some cash onhand for when we revert to the mean  this post was from my brain to your fingers   fellow pltr and rklb shareholder here   

i absolutely love both companies and i implicitly
trust the leadership at bothbut its been impossible for me to keep plowing into both at the rate at which i had planned to continue at this point because 1 im not made of money and 2 as you said buying at 2766 is a whole different deal than it was at 822

i have not and certainly do not anticipate selling a single share of either anytime on the foreseeable horizon and my solution has been weekly dca of small amounts 5 pltr10 rklb

im extremely thankful to have established my core positions in both companies when i did but i also thought id have a lot more time to make bulk purchases   pitfalls of dcaing into entry  be greedy when those around you are scarred  be scared when those around you are greedy  corrections happen no need to worry about them if youre investing longterm just dca if its a worry for you  i needed to hear this thank you im selling some of my bags for some profit and leaving a few just in case it tanks  no  why you never seen a holiday season before  as a long term investor not really pes in general are ridiculous and seem unsustainable but that trend has been building for a while with a surprisingly long uptrend

in times like this i downshift from picking discounted good value stocks to buying indices and slowly expanding my cash reserves

i have a vibe that the incoming administration will give some surprises to precipitate a panic crash on this overpriced market sooner or later but i have anticipated many more crashes than reality has delivered so in hindsight im glad i havent acted aggressively to sell anytime my positions felt overvalued

i know enough to know i personally cant anticipate what will happen in the markets to justify major portfolio pivots keeping a cash cushion for buying dips and being able to handle a layoff without needing to sell depressed equities is always sound though  im right here with you bought brkb today for this exact reason thoughts anyone

edit i actually moved my investment in smh to brkb and might consider furthering this position  cautiously adding to investments  specifically those that have room to grow or future catalysts coming  i am one  yup  so what do you do to protect yourself buy puts sell calls trailing stops  im not really in any of those stocks listed so im not really concerned my positions are doing well definitely ran up with everything else but multiples arent unreasonable  im a big believer in ignoring the noise you need a strategy and you need to stick to it if youre trading in such a way that short term moves will make it break you youre screwed  2021 reasons for market peaks are not the same reasons for 2024 market peaks  in 2021 the richest companies in the world were not in a race against each other to have the bestest fastest ai solution and throwing billions of dollars at it and set to make trillions from their investment  ive definitely taken some chips off the table  so when stocks are going up because investors see the intrinsic value stay on the sidelines  ok  got it  i was this person early last year kept holding cash in hysa missed out on all gains imo when reddit is skeptical well see a roaring rally and face ripping journey to new aths  sofi pltr and rklb have ridiculous valuations sofi and rklb are consistently cash flow negative as for palantir it has a ps ratio of 61 and a pfcf  sbc ratio of 342 clown market  people have been concerned about the market jump for a year now and its continuing to rise   what youtube videos are you seeing on your feed everything i get is this just like 1929 we are gunna b fukt  the best thing to do during a market rally is to stay put  how long is your investment horizon if its 5 years i would close the news enjoy a cocktail and not think about this   with tariffs coming in obviously the only winners will be elon stocks and uranium something has to power all these shitty evs and ai  no

trump is good news for the market  a kind redditor suggested me to sell only the part of stocks that covers your initial investment cost basis and hold on to the rest if the market bonks then good yu can buy the dip if the market stonks then good too  with buffets selling and holding cash im playing it a little safe too sold a portion of tech stocks and im holding defensive like costco and walmart ofc it could all just be fine but id rather stay cautious and not lose 15 than make like 5 more

edit i put a bit of the cash into gold just in case  well this exuberance i think will have a burst until inauguration unless we get launched into ww3  sp will rise another 15 in the coming months then some early warnings signs from trumps tariffs trigger a bigger correction  i do think there are good deals in the sectors you mentioned but also in emerging ones as well quantum computing has growth opportunities nuclear and nuclear adjacent smrs uranium mining battery technology devcoolingstorage all having opportunities albeit speculative but they are there  all of the doomtalk in this thread bolsters my opinion that lowering interest rates will keep the market turbocharged as money flows out of bondstreasuries and into stocks  i feel like the sky is about to fall articles are intended to scare retail

if reddit was confident id be worried  time in the market not time the market  just pick ones that are undervalued avoid those overvalued overhyped ones you never know when or if a correction will take place but if it happens the ones that will drop the most are the overvalued ones  yea i feel ya i would keep some cash on the sidelines but keep we you have heck buy some puts depending on how big your port is  this is beyond a bubble were heading into tulip mania 20  i went to cash booked double digit profits the incoming dopes are called dopes for a reason beware  bull market will continue dont be timid  why would be concerned now  it has continuously gone up and retraced down and then up again 
just keep buying dont overthink and try to time the market  sold all my stocks to lock profits the only stocks im looking now are ba googl grab nke and baba also there must be some reason buffet is hoarding cash right now  the current exuberance is an attempt to cash in before the orange anus tanks the economy after the inauguration  i didnt understand the cash on hand tactic but i found out from my broker fidelity that they give you monthly interest on the settled cash in your account i assume thats one factor as to why when the market becomes a little too uncertain for you close positions and collect interest on your cash for a few months

i had about 80 cash at one time for a couple months because i was shifting and taking gains on positions

it was a nice surprise cause i had no idea until the interest payment popped up on my transactions list  its literally just a santa rally  i am concerned it may pause  but is pe out of line  thinking ill do cubed calls on my gains like sofi lyg pltr ionq rgtietc if they exercise im at a profit  i share your sentiment and have shifted to collars on some of my more volatile holds to protect gains  invest for long and dollar cost average into quality etfs  httpswwwmultplcomshillerpehttpswwwmultplcomshillerpe

yeah i am putting all new money in my vtip position until this changes  might not be too popular of an opinion although it might be seen just fine in this specific thread but you probably have about 2 and a half months left before there are any issues edit really should say 3 so ill say im not counting this month im thinking about 2025

the thing thats been missing in this run is a new all time high by the russell 2000 and it at least apparently finally came last week its stalled some after hitting on monday but i think something similar to 2021 is possible with it pushing hard into early next year and then topping out

the thing that i doubt we see if were going to compare to then is large caps managing to hold up into the midterm year while small caps get hit after this peak occurs because the sp has blown away any realistic expectations this year if youre looking for a repeat of 2017 not necessarily saying you are just thinking out loud i think youre going to be pretty darn disappointed next year  finally a responsible and careful analysis and comments  i sold ms at 40 i recommend only selling 12  when people start talking about nfps again im selling everything  people felt this way about apple and microsoft in 2010  why dont you guys start a hedge position instead of selling buy some long dated puts to hedge if you do not want to miss out on potential rise up in the stock price so you can sleep peacefully  dont sell because of price change sell because of thesis change did you buy sofi because you thought someday they could compete with jpm then keep it theyre on their way  i like tom lee he thinks sp 15000 by 2030 if thats the case then we are on track if not have room to run technological super revolution or what have you  yes no beuno  i sold my rddt at 15350 so  so sad could have sold at 158  lets wait until uer and cpi come out this fortnight  it seems very difficult to find any good deals considering literally almost every sector in the stock market is just going up vertically

look outside the us market there are tons of good opportunities in other countries south korea for example is insanely cheap  no one knows shit but as for me im diversifying and taking some money off the table moving from individual stocks to etfs and cashgoldwee bit of crypto  you own stocks whose value is entirely speculative based purely on hopes for the future if this isnt money you can afford to speculate with i suggest you act accordingly better yet see a feebased financial advisor   youre dealing with three roulette wheel companies not the most typical ones out there  looking like a blow off top  market what does that even mean these days dont 7 stocks control the market at this pointamazing  this is even mentioned on this sub  the rocket lab facebook group is buying at 20 and ive been adamant on saying your gonna get dumped on but they dont wanna hear this or that about a company with debt and a reusable rocket that can deliver a payload ok thats a serviceand its not marketable or profitable yet soooooovervalued i got out at 22  learning to ride these breakouts is difference between good and bad investor nothing fundamentally has changed until hotter cpi on dec 11th things are fine  good post  2021 is the covid crash  i bought pltr 7 when it hit 66 sold 20 of it which ill invest elsewhere massive profit off that 20 the remaining 80 ill just let it ride for now  if i tried to figure out if market run ups were good or bad id probably lose every single time 

the answer i dont know i invest in a way that makes sense for me dca into good etfs and companies i believe are winners i win some i lose some but in the long run im making money whether the market goes up or down  shitcos and meme stocks arent the market  no ive been buying like clockwork mid cap value just started printing my utility stocks are chugging along and throwing off dividends theres no point in selling now 
im much more concerned about my bond funds and the possibilities of more inflation  i expect it go keep going up over december but you need to get the story out there to sell to the average joe as the smart money leaves the market  i do have my reservations that the market just keeps on jumping like crazy but the last couple of years have been great and obviously we have a nice cushion of gains so if theres any drop in the market in the short term were still up a ton im going to take some gains come january  case in point global markets investor on x americans stock market expectations have never been higher 56 of us consumers expect higher stock prices over the next 12 months the highest since this question was first asked in 1987 at the same time households are allin on stocks this is a recipe for a disaster httpstcoxvneluvgcq  xhttpsxcomglobalmktobservstatus1861779513522221402  the market is and has been very overvalued the pe ratios have been very high and unsustainable  price the market in gold and you may get a clear answer  thats why im taking a decent position into nike today 

damn near at its price from pandemic

please and thank you great cyber monday deal  fomo can be tempting but patience and reevaluation are key  i buy stocks i like turtles   this is the age of the retail investor  many folks that have never been in the market are starting to get smart and invest because they are now realizing how fucked the system is  you have to invest to not lose to inflation  brokerage accounts are the new modern day savings bank accounts  0 interest or 10 fake interest  take your pick  this is the cause of the massive market pump  people have been saying thr stock market is overvalued since 2016 i remember buying just 110th of a bitcoin at 8000 instead of a full coin because 8000 seemed way too high for something that was 2000 earlier in the year

you never know safer to stay in than out  yes im up 200 ytd in my taxable account and 300 in my roth mostly hood shares and calls but i see tons of screenshots on twitter of people up just as much and lots more simply holding highly speculative stocks like rklb ionq etc a mean correction wipe out all those gains is in the works  thank you for jinxing it  im wondering what stock youtubers will jump on next

they were choking on pltr and sofi  there is a huge amount of money sitting in bitcoin blue chips bonds and tesla lol that can cycle out to small caps at the moment a lot of it is stagnant and where it is as a safe holding place but the world is dogeatdog and there can easily be a massive shift to small capsin the words of clint eastwood deserves got nothing to do with it  i predict the markets will shift toward a posttruth environment until the government runs out of money but i am not sure i can guess the timing to turn my prediction into a fortune even if i am eventually right  a bull market is like sex it feels best just before it ends  barton biggs

i think were overvalued consumers are over extended and we have a lot of incoming uncertainty  

deregulations may be coming and tarrifs may be coming  

i think real estate and rent prices are outrageously inflated too

i think the sp will be choppy curved ups and downs over a long time but more down than up  itll rebound hold what youve got and buy when its on sale 

but the economy as a whole as consumers is concerned thats headed for a tougher time  you are right on the money i think were due for a big correction before and during the next earning seasons and once tariffs become a reality  we have smci at 42 a share and youre saying theres no good deals lmao  any thoughts on wmt stock  i need advice also southwest  i dont think yall understand pltr relative to the big four of the industrial military complex  if musk is in fact involved at all he will absolutely make contractors operate more similarly to how palantir and spacex operate in the defense market this makes me bullish on pltr and any method that allows me to buy into that cultural style  if i could buy into spacex starlink etc then i would  tulips anyone  been concerned ever since covid tbh i prefer to remain ready even if i lose potential profits  pe ratios are super high i put stoplimit orders to prevent a disaster im with you this market seems like a house of cards ready to tip over  its definitely very frothy but these things happens im dollar cost averaging in but not adding anything extra  i think pltr and rkbl are the exception considering that both have heavy ties with the usa and good government contracts as well as business with other american companies tesla might suffer the most considering newsom wants to take away their ev credit for california and they denied his buyback request weirdly enough i think intel is going to do really good if trump goes through with implementing tariffs on everyone but yeah if you know youll struggle to stay afloat if the market goes down id say pull some money out because that might turn into the emergency fund you need if not then there might be opportunities to get stocks on sale  i am conservative and thought costco was super overvalued at 880 great business but ridiculous peno telling how long this can continue  the indexes have been gradually going up since the start is it one big bubble and will it eventually crash down or will it keep going up and is this the reason the gap between poor and rich people is increasing


you invested in the right stocks and are mainly seeing growth there are quite some stocks that havent been performing well the past year and i agree some really seem overvalued


tesla almost soared 50 since trump got reelected while trump wants to do less for the ev market  the biggest difference from 2021 and now is that 2021 was the height of wfhwork from home and low supply it was also the tipping point when interest rates were hiked to combat inflation

the whole market took a downturn because of the interest hikes but theyve recovered since as interest rate cuts were getting on the table

you are right to be skeptical not because there will be a natural correction but the catalyst for this correction is going to come from the stupidest president weve ever had in history if you dont recall the buffoon would swing the market in all directions every time he opened his mouth if that doesnt ring a bell every decision he has made has made a negative impact on our economy and in respect the market as whole as well

thats my 2 cents  i see ultra wealthy adding cash and have thought it was a little over bought for the last 115 years ive been not investing as much upgrading things around the house and went on a nice vacation im going to stack a good amount of cash this year while i figure out what to do  its definitely time to sell the market is not reflecting the real world i guarantee we are going to see new all time lows this year  stonks only go up

but to answer your question no not really i run a futures model alongside my portfolio if the market crashes ill probably end flat plus or minus a few points  get your stops ready  when the media and everyone else was worried about a recession over the last three years i held and kept adding  two weeks ago i spent some time contemplating where things may go in the future  i figured i was content with my gains that there is too much uncertainty in the air and that i shouldnt get greedy chasing a few more points  now my position is all cash  now is the time to take some gains im looking to rebalance my account to 50 cash  this crash is going to be the biggest most widespread of all time 

4 years of fake unemployment numbers and inflation data lol the inflation data being fake is also the only thing that has prevented the great depression 20

inflation was actually so high stocks are justified ironically but still millions of sheep believe we had 3 so by that definition market is massively overbought

mmw the job market is down bad once the sp inflows stop and the index bubble is popped component stocks within them will fall by 3x that

just wait and the new administration has both inflationary policies and economy crippling gov reduction and deportations lol  no  trimming or taking profit is always a good idea because you are essentially cutting out risk every price increase adds risk  yes the market feels like 2021 and were gonna get a pullback  the three stock you mention sofi pltr and rklb are definitely more trading stocks instead of investing stocks   they are going to be way more volatile than google or apple or the sp index  ive had a great two year run so ive sold a little of my volatile stocks and moved it to brkb   nah i think the stocks will continue to rise till mid decemeber  an expert told me to take profits in nvidia in the low 200s of course way before the most recent splitthank goodness i turned the other cheek  nope  trump is amazing for the market  the federal government is cooked if the consumer is sent into another state of price gouging  do you know what a collar is  yep took some profits on things that jumped up a lot especially thanks to bitty and trump winning and sitting those on cash for now i have about 25 cash now  sell everything by jan    ive assessed the threat tariffs pose to every stock i own i have identified several that i will sell in their entirety around the inauguration if not before several others i plan to trim  some considerably a few i wont touch ill probably end up in 35  40 cash once tariffs start being placed on our allies 

i will have a plan both to move back into the market if tariffs arent as high and expansive as expected and a plan to sell further investments if tariffs are higher than currently expected  i feel the same exact way  at this point every up day im selling portions of big winners which includes sofi and pltr im not selling all at once because you cant time the market but i am taking chunks off the table because i agree it feels like its run too much im keeping the cash or reinvesting into stocks i feel are cheap more value based low fpe

but yeah things feel frothy and the bozos are everywhere calling for 10x after 10x someone will be holding the bag and it wont be me at least not a full bag  the market is ripe with manipulation right now the economy was shit under trump at the end but people are dumb and forget also economies generally dont do well long term in anti democratic governments but i only have all of human civilization backing up that statement so really who can say how it will go this time  deleted  you should kept your eye on hims  cant time the top a win is a win  would have sold at 25 if i had it  sold out at 40 a couple hours before earnings average cost was 1650 thats just how it goes sometimes  nope in fact im gonna double down long at these all time highs because highs lead to more highs

 investing 101

you cant time the market

if you cant beat the crazy join the crazy  i sold some at 30  25 at 40 and got out at 60  im right there with you i sold my 500 shares  8 on friday before they were set to release q3 earnings on the following monday because i believed the stock price at 42 was overvalued earnings get released and for the next several days the price moves to the upside to now 6667 this has been my biggest regret in investing throughout my time in the market  bought at 9 i sold at 27 right there with ya brothersister  i sold it at all 27  but then again i advised against ebay at 2 amazon at 13 cuz they werent gonna make any money  ive stopped listening to myself and have done better  yeah the pe was already huge at around 40 fundamentals dont seem to have a lot to do with the 50 increase since then  i sold at 24 or 25   i sold nvda at 600 because it was about to tank  same lol was in at 7 sold everything at 40  it was its just more overvalued now  i did it at 26  no business went bust taking profits  do you think a trailing stop limit loss order is more suitable in this scenario instead of just selling the stocks we think as overvalued  same   its still overpriced  it was    335 pe really  profit is profit  sold tesla at 256  40 here a bunch of stocks have separated from fundamentals and we have a presidentelect who is threatening a whole bunch of tariff taxes and deporting a bunch of workers when it falls assuming it will eventually revert to mean it is going to fall extra hard  i bought pltr at 16 based of an article i saw about them acquiring a contract with the nhs then it dipped for a while and i panic sold when it hit 18 i cant let go of the loss i had 200 shares man  it was and it is  if inflation goes high cash may not be the best holding  but i dont know what will be the best other than having debt  yeah i am concerned about a correction but i wouldnt want to go all cash just due to missing out on further gains i am planning to move my more risky positions to consumer staples over the next couple days i feel like reducing risk is still a grey area near timing the market but not as equally but opposite risky as going all cash  cash is still paying almost 5 so its not a terrible time to sit on the sidelines for a while  i trimmed most of my positions in stocks but still hold about 15 this limits my overall risk  i agree  im not looking at a full cash out but im selling some shares of voo from my various retirement accounts to get a bit cash balanced  my portfolio was about 93 stock and 7 cash 

ive sold about 15 so far into cash and may take things to a 6040 split  i also intend on stacking cash over the next 12 months and making my savings go straight cash instead of into equities  

sp500 is up like 28 this year  would be foolish to not expect a correction  im not all doom and gloom so wont sell everything but i do want to take some profits and have some cash ready to buy the dip  since im selling within my ira and 401k i dont have to pay taxes unless i pull the money which im not  time in the market beats timing the market

but having cash is not bad just dont sell everything lol  i mean you really need to look at the tech stocks individually

when it comes to the magnificent 7 i can agree on most of them being stupidly overvalued right now especially nvda aapl  tsla i dont think that msft is insanely overvalued but its definitely pretty pricey right now googl on the other hand i think is still a great buy today given that its trading for under a 20 forward pe ratio and who knows how the monopoly trial stuff will even turn out at this point itll take years to fully play out imo its got a good margin of safety right now  so lame we havent even started getting frothy in small caps  what do people mean by moving to cash  my first job where i had a 401k was in the late 90s when the stock market was going like gang busters  i piled money into the stuff all the market gurus were extolling only in time for the dotcom crash and subsequent recession  quite a lesson and made me more conservative in investments until i realized i missed much of the markets recovery and growth and finally piled in again when stock investing was all the rage and investment news media was all positive excited about hitting new highs on top of interest rate cuts and everyone and their cousin getting into retail investing  i neglected the lesson i learned the previous time and was caught off guard like everyone else as things fell off a cliff  at least this time i knew to not panic sell and once things bottomed get fully invested

i dont bother trying to time the market or predict when itll peak  but in hindsight the analysis shows how the market got ahead of itself  some tells are when bad news has no negative effect on the sp pe ratios are spiking but only insiders are selling and various economic indicators are off yet the market seems to just shrug and power on up  sometimes retail investors are frothy over some new tech or new investment vehicle that is hard to understand with stories of some ordinary guys becoming an overnight billionaire

its almost funny how quickly and suddenly this turns into a panic followed by doom and gloom as everyones investments drop precipitously and stories of a few overnight billionaires become replaced by stories of a lot of overnight paupers  news media becomes dour and scolding of illinformed investors government figures wring hands etc etc

anyway all this to say i personally am feeling deja vu big time  no shortage of bad news out there yet the market ignores it and presses higher  i love the stock discussions here on reddit but i get very similar vibes to the everyones an investor vibes of past bubbles  and there seem to not be a shortage of indicators flagging problem territory

so yes this recent jump up i think is concerning but moreso the general sentiment and behaviors feel like how its felt at past peaks in the lead up to a sudden decline

as it happens im close enough to retirement to need to rebalance anyway so im using it as an opportunity to significantly reduce my stock market exposure and start getting set more into incomegenerating investments like treasuries mm cds  moving out of individual stock picks and into value mutual funds and watching for funds overinvested in faang stocks

for those not about to retire i wouldnt say get out of the market but rather be more diligent about your investment choices  watch out for hype stocks dont believe you know more than you think you do diversify dont be shy about taking your profits and really contemplate how your gut would feel if a third of your investment disappeared over a few days  if you suspect that might make you sell you might want to rethink about reducing your risk levels  this is the right approach there is nothing wrong with taking profit after something goes up 4x in a relatively short span of time sometimes companies valuations get so steep they greatly exceed any short or medium term fundamentals and it can take a few years for those to catch up to the price such is probably the case for pltr although ultimately it may go higher but it probably wont 4x from here for 510 years valuations can get stupid though maybe pltr does another 4x in 2025 im not saying thats completely outside the realm of possibility but there are other opportunities out there with a higher margin of safety for example i think reddit has a good chance to do another 2x over the next 12 months  asml is looking mighty fine right now  yes asml especially with their new 1nm fabrication unit  bro i just found mpwr  i think it is a freat tike to buy  buy the rumor sell the news  i even want to trim my brkb homeboy warren stopped buying back his own stock when it was 15 lower than it is currently hes choosing cash instead maybe i should do the same  berkshires most recent acquisitions are dominoes and a company that makes pool toys  the best way to follow warren is to buy his company  in before the markets rip for the santa rally

lololol  buffet keeps underperforming the market lol  warren cant even beat the market his actions mean nothing

we are in the next wave of the bull market   the best thing you can ever do with an investment is preserve capital

how is this have so many up votes the best you can do is preserve capital no fuck that the best you can do is make returns  lots of signs that we head towards spx 8k yes for sure signs of crash or correction oh please lol  despite you saying ur planning on retiring in a few years i feel like you are only 35  what do you hold or would buy in robotics today  i agree with that choice of sectors  evtol is another that will certainly experience pull backs so taking profits to be in a position to buy dips is important  another thing to consider is what will change when the russian ukrainian war ends  oil and uranium will be affected though uranium will continue to climb long term so ill buy that dip if it comes  companies like spai stand to make bank removing land mines  any other post war plays i am missing  what types of robotics  do you think people are investing in tech that is hard even for tech people when astrologists will proclaim a week of stagflation  a month can mean losing out on 150 of gains depending on the stock its very possible for it to never pull back to the amount it is now 

remember all the gains people lost selling at the  start of the pandemic shutdowns and then pausing buying due to uncertainty 

you my friend are trying to time the market which goes against basic investing fundamentals 

if you have the capital and have a nest egg built continue to buy through the peaks and valleys thats how youll make money  deleted  even if there is the market will bounce back ive been investing for 10 years and everytime i panic sold ive lost out hold for the long haul  what makes you say there will be a significant correction ive heard there are strong similarities to dot com do you think the correction will be driven by tariffs are investors going to realize ai will not be creating as much value as we thought it would  having gotten infected by a bloated tick with lyme disease some years ago i love this picture of a bloated tick being about to pop   you cant completely compare the stock market to shitcoins that are actively burning their own supply to drive up the price  i just consider that the govt is printing money every second of everyday a pullback may happen  but for how long before money floods the markets again  this is the new normal and we are entering the biggest bull run of our time every time someone thinks this isnt normal or rational the stock market goes up even more and you just missed out on tons of gains  i did but then im near retirement moved from 1000 to 8020 stockbond ratio

ive hit my numbers for retirement and the saying when youve won quit playing gets truer every day  deleted  someone who predicting the worlds end will eventually be right doesnt mean everyone should be listened to  there are lot of similarities between this year and 2007 yield curve inversion continuing claims setting new 2year highs constant layoffs jobs are hard to find markets shrugging off weak economic news

its hard to tell how long this will continue but it always resolves at some point when it becomes hard to deny economic reality

retail is euphoric at the worse time possible i guess the history is repeating itself  but apple trades at almost 40x forward earnings in spite of singledigit revenue growth how much should we paying for a company that is stagnating innovationwise  how many weeks out  yeah but op is suggesting the opposite  lock in some gains be a little fearful while everyone is greedy

nothing wrong with taking some gains and moving it to something a bit safer  there will be a dip at some point and its always good to have some dry powder  being fully ported on pltr rklb and sofi is probably not the most ideal portfolio for protecting gains and then if there is a dip you can always move back into some more plays with a higher upside  if were going with anecdotes warren buffet pulled out his money right before the dot com bubble and 2008 and probably made significant gains being able to buy stocks at a lower valuation when things are overpriced they are overpriced  but very few are actually expecting a crashsee this global markets investor on x americans stock market expectations have never been higher 56 of us consumers expect higher stock prices over the next 12 months the highest since this question was first asked in 1987 at the same time households are allin on stocks this is a recipe for a disaster httpstcoxvneluvgcq  xhttpsxcomglobalmktobservstatus1861779513522221402  yep you will  realized 50 gains and the my stock grew 30 more before everyone lost 80 of the stock value 
could never financially recover from this better be greedy till the end  then stop coming on here every day  dae a little bit concerned with this rally

yes every time the market goes up a little ways some dude chimes in with this and the market will still continue on upward on the whole anyway  someone is taking notes from jim roppel  lots of people were scared of kamala being president

is that why bond markets are assuming trump will increase inflation

she ran on taxing unrealized gains imagine being you with 100000 on positive growth in your account and then all of the sudden you get a tax bill for that

it was a tax against people with nws of over 100 million 

this had lots of people sitting on cash trump becoming president elect resulted in cash pouring into the market overnight resulting in a continuation of this rally

the market was reaching new records constantly before the election weve been in a run for a while  which makes no sense because that would only apply to the obscenely wealthy but yeah i could see people not understanding  i wouldnt be pulling out until 2nd week january   in march i too will be addressing my positions  i never heard of umac until thursday night at thanksgiving with my cousin  i bought 150 shares on friday morning  needless to say i bought him a few nice meals over the weekend  this just makes me wonder how tesla is soaring right now tesla is losing its share of the ev market in america possibly losing the ev tax credit and their self driving seems so far behind waymo i think its inevitable that chinese evs will penetrate more markets outside of asia this and the tariffs will absolutely affect teslas pricing and ability to be competitive overseas there seems to be a massive faith in elons ability to swing the government in a way that will allow him to deploy his autonomous taxi system i own a tesla and have very little faith elon can do this  isnt it the opposite when people are buying that means the value is likely higher than what people are purchasing the shares for when people panic and sell its because they have a realization that the stocks they are holding are worth much less than the current selling price when enough people panic and sell that is what causes the crash  do you think wmt stock will dip anytime soon   like you i like quantum computingalthough i believe that the real growth in this field are 35 years out  remember when japans interest rates dropped us stocks hard a few months back and brokers stopped retail buying during the biggest stock sell off of probably a decade but institutional investors were not locked out   

100 evidence of how the system is manipulated to fuck over the retail investors  

why is there not an investigation into the retail lock out  ah yes just use a subjective valuation scale to make moves thats never burned anyone  if the market corrects everything will correct regardless of their value  i am with you this growth seems unjustified i am starting to see earning reports that are disappointing wall street along with a 26 unemployment for tech workers i am perplexed to see the market grow everyday with so many red flags  agree  yup people are so irrational its why most would be better suited with a money manager  for 12 months  ho ho ho  those are growth companies pe alone is a terrible measure without looking into the company and whats coming  they really need to be quoting more like late 2021 through a lot of 2022 but what happened then was very nasty and arguably wasnt viewable in the indexes could in the nasdaq some but even there it didnt do it justice

you can relate it back to covid some but it was more like the interest rateinflation hysteria  apple walmart costco all at 40 fwd pes  its called a bull market not overbought you will be figuring and missing out  this year is only 4 weeks    i think 2nd week in january will be telling  this year within a month whats the catalyst  this is my thought as well  yes i agree cut your winners short never let them keep riding s  space industry is projected to hit 1t in 5 years rklb by todays standards is the investing stock  rklb is  an investing stock and you have no clue what youre talking about its ok rklb just isnt the one for you invest in what you understand because it clearly isnt rklb  mid december is next week  deleted  u mad bro    being cautious is zero financial knowledge sure  thats it man  yeah but he purchased at ipo price about 36  jk jk  well i bought at 599 and sold at 15 so yeah  exact same situation with me sold at 40 with average cost of 1550 but profits not realized was never my money anyway   you are my twin  bubbles buy yachts   last words of a man about to lose everything  right just ask the tech investors from 2001  this is the correct take like why exit your entire position all at once make a strategic tiered exit  8 to 42 is fucking amazing should not feel too much regret  i get the feeling traders are trying to push it to 69 because you know thats shit they do but i cant see it holding this valuation  id say that was a smart move these growth stocks are gambling at this point  this has been my biggest regret in investing throughout my time in the market

i started buying amd at 11 because i realized zen would take huge chunks out of intels market i sold around 2024

that said i have made a lot of money from them anyway by buyingselling at different levels and i expect to keep making more from them

good knowledge in a specific market is a gold mine  this isnt always the case both nvidia and zscaler dropped a lot while they both beat expectations  this is almost exactly what i did i said 30 not a chance  itll be back there eventually dont worry lol

i bought at 14 sold at 29 even 29 was ridiculously priced 60 makes no sense  i sold 90 of my holdings as well and of course its continued to go up since then   right now  silver and gold are slightly inflated  gold is down a little bit but i think if the dollar gets stronger it will approach closer to 2500  silver at 30 is risky  i have prior silver purchases that im holding  i might buy more if this drops to 25

platinum and palladium are actually great value right now  platinum has bounced between 8001200 the past few years and offers solid value around 9501000 right now  palladium is a little more volatile right now since russia is a large miner of it  also some loosening demand with auto industry moving towards evs

if i had to choose to anchor my portfolio i would probably hold platinum right now  tbh i dont know that consumer staples are much safer traditionally sure but if excessive valuation is the concern are they now costco trades at 58x earnings pg 31 walmart 38 these three account for over 30 of xlp the consumer staples sector you can go down the list and find less preposterous valuations of course but still sky high across the board  serious question if you dont take the profit and i assume are unlikely to any time soon then how are you missing out on profit at these levels it seems like youre only going to miss a large drop that falls away below where we are now whether that takes 1 year or 3  what broker are you using  is this through a high yield savings account  it also limits potential gains for the next cycle up if the correction doesnt occur for another 612 months and the correction is small those gains could very well be larger than any subsequent declines  msft is up almost doubly since theyve been doubling down on ai bullshit in 2023 so yeah they are overpriced af as well as  googl is dead and doesnt know it yet

ai has killed search forever i worked 10 years in search its dead now all that remains is for people to realize  take the free 4 gains in money market rather than risking losses in equities  solid advice here thanks for sharing your experiences  i have parked cash in bonds preferreds and some money market etfs it would be a miracle if theres not at least a correction or two by june next year  down 24 in 3 months   curious of what you think of investing in leveraged long semiconductor like soxw i would say now is the time to buy them up and then attach a 3 trailing stop loss after buying if semiconductor stocks sink another 10 then repeat this and you will eventually catch the bottom and make money when asml and other semiconductor companies rebound  also considering jumpin in  yes friend we should all do the needful and purchase wonderful company mpwr  sell the news buy the rumor  im not saying anyone here knows better than warren buffet but look at his holdings right now not exactly positioned for high growth  remindme 1 year  look for an eft like iqm 

even igm for expanded exposure to tech without having to pick single winners  kernel holding will go up if the war ends in a way that is any way favourable for ukraine  waiting to buy the dip is what made me lose the best opportunities
dca all the way  i dont follow  you are delusional my friend specific stocks go up 100 every month did you buy those specific stocks

i am fine with waiting until im satisfied with macroeconomic outlook i dont have fomo

i dont think you understand the concept of risk adjusted returns  is it timing the market to wait out uncertain times i thought timing the market was trying to buy at low points and sell high at points  tariffs and counter tariffs trade wars inflation flare up higher unemployment slow ai adoption higher for longer interest rates labour market shortage esp on the low skill end agriculture pick your poison

apart from a correction one scenario no one is discussing but not so unlikely is a rangebound sideways market where earnings slowly grow and prices are stagnant to get pe back to more reasonable levels sp500 andor dow ends 2025 just 5  ouch  im glad youre alive and still investing  not true the us federal reserve has been reducing the money supply over the last two years this reduction is primarily due to the fed shrinking its balance sheet and rising interest rates which have led to a decline in savings deposits and a decrease in the m2 money supply by about 700 billion since the rate hiking cycle began the feds balance sheet has been reduced by approximately 800 billion as it stopped reinvesting maturing securities contributing to this contraction in money supply  gonna save this comment for 6 months later  you sound afraid of missing out  ive been thinking the same for a while now

the world is changing so fast on so many levels out with the old in with the new as an example who would have thought that people would rather get their daily news from you tubers and turn their back on mainstream media mainstream media is going the way of the newspaper  the market warren b has known so well has never had the worlds richest companies in a ai race throwing billions and billions of dollars at winning that race

the world is gearing up for a new world order with ai and the market is buzzing for it

this is where i think og wazzas warren buffet tried and tested ways are becoming out of touch with where the big big money is currently to be had    shit hes done phenomenal at keeping up with modern markets compared to the the generation he grew up in  hes nearly a hundred and its amazing hes still doing so well but yeah i think his legacy teaches us a lot but were most likely at a point where we should no longer follow his actions verbatim  
a teacher to learn from and grow from but not to duplicate his exact actions  yeah fundamentals have gone out the window for years the fact that gme still has value is enough to validate this so who knows rings true till someone way above our pay grade decides to pull the rug  i prefer a mix but usually start with shorter term otm calls from weeks to a month out from expiration if the stock moves against you higher you can roll position to extend expiration further into future

the longer away the expiration the more the call acts like shorting the stock  less theta decay but you profit from big moves downward but usually if you start with longer term expirations  why not just close your long position to begin with usually people do this is they are trying to avoid paying capital gains and want to hold the stock longterm even through a market correction  what if you locked in those gains that amounted to a sizeable portion of your portfolio say 30 then the market continued to rally with no substantial pull back for the next say 34 years or you could just be invested in the market for a long term play

  
locking in gains is timing the market if youre going to want to do this in any meaningful way youd likely be talking a sizeable portion of your portfolio say 30 to try and catch a peak sell then a bottom buy in  if youre only talking about locking in small amount of gains say 5 of your portfolio then you may as well keep it in the marketlol  i have extremely strong genes very high brain a hugely good brain  i dont consider myself obscenely wealthy and i transferred cash to moment trump became president elect  congrats make sure to sell before the inevitable dump  you can toss fundamentals in the dumpster and burn that dumpster on tesla until you see the most likely inevitable fallout between elon and trump due to them both having a strong case of main character syndrome

the only thing thats going to halt tesla from seeing 500 next year is if we see the nasdaq itself get hammered and if so itll probably not get hit as hard as it was in 2022  because the valuation is a collective measure of future outcomes markets are more open these days especially in the us and people are more optimistic by nature and so far theres no limit on future growth of tesla since musk proved that he is a hardware midas tesla can extended in any segment or a vertical of the market and theyre executing the only risk would be other competition but theres no sight and tesla likely vacuumed all the talent on the market i dont touch it as this seems too optimistic but welp i keep not making money from tsla long dated calls it is plus theres a whole planet that needs to stop smoking the air  maybe in the short term w tariffs theyd be paying it first before passing it on to the consumer so id expect a dip  any companies you like in that space  i absolutely remember and thats just one example

retail is systematically locked out or manipulated at pretty much every level of the stock market  ive gotten better at filtering out the noise but theres a lot of it and theres no way that any retail investor could ever make up the information gap  all you can do is try to guess right as to what the powersthatbe will eventually do in regards to the finance industry  26 unemployment for tech workers is a drop in the ocean compared to when ai is fully up and running and screaming along   if i was in tech i would be looking for a new career one that ai cant take from me  no better time to be a plumber   im not sure where you get your data but you might want to unsubscribe only cost among those 3 is at 40 fpe  i have most my money in bitcoin right now not missing out on anything ive been buying better stuff for my house kids and myself ive been looking at some stuff in the ai space asml and amd

what are you buying or looking at i really only know bitcoin and tech companies  let them people are silly   i said trim 
not sell entire position

your statement doesnt make logical sense i never implied to never let winners keep riding trimming 10 of position means you let 90 keep riding

greed kills

if we all could predict the future which we cant then its easy to say that winners will keep winning or running

heres a prime example i was up 550 on lunr last jan bought around 25 it ran up to 14 or so i sold around 12 had i held and hoped it would just keep running future is so easy to predict s id watch it plunge from 14 back to 3s

risk management is a thing

and please dont respond with
why you taking this so personally or something of the like  i would agree a small portion of your investment plan could include rklb just as a portion of my plan includes oklo because i believe in nuclear but its going to be a stock with a lot of volatility and if you are expecting any type of pull back its one one the ones thats gonna be hit hard in the short term   i hold shares too and im not adding at a price to sales of 35 thats just stupid rklb is a meme stock and has been since a meme stock since august if you look into a wsb daily chat rklb is high up there  considering it shows up on rwallstreet bets 100 times per week means its still a trading stock and expect volatility   remindme 3 months  how do you feel about your 11 drop today  you may want to reconsider what you think a safe investment is   i bought at 27 17 10  9  7 and still holding 2200 shares  i feel like i have a knack for finding these gems early unfortunately i get bored easy and leave before all the excitement happens  removed  reporting for duty  yachts  i 6xed my stock but im mad i didnt 8x it

foh  i mean standard ta indicates a pullback at around 69 or a pull out  this is what ive been trying to tell myself ever since trump got elected because it breaks me that i sold all 550 of my shares around 26 avg was 17 nope just keeps going up  well i was figuring they will do better in a highinflationary period and they have a lower beta what would you suggest if trying to thread the needle between volatility and cash equivalents  well for one thing it depends on your circumstances i am retired so i am not adding to my position its easier for someone not needing the money for 510 years to be able to ignore volatility

that aside there is always profit to be missed on any given day depending how complete your information is if i can cash out and it drops 10 and then i cash back in i made 10 ish of my money obviously we cant predict the future though but everyone is always missing out on potential profit every day because nobodys prediction skills are 100 and most are way way way less

i dont quite understand the second part of your question but hopefully the answer i gave is general enough that my take is still relevant  vanguard  i use vmfxx vanguard federal money market fund to hold all noninvested cash its currently paying 457  either a hysa or a money market fund like spaxx  could be
im up 98 over the past year which is good enough for me i was 100 invested in small caps and micro caps none of it in sp so far riskier

put most of my profits in savings account if market keeps going up ill likely keep making profits on my remaining positions id rather not have all my money in the market bc i need a cushion to pay taxes and other bills lol

i also prefer trimming a proportion of my positions at a key target level that way i wont miss out on further gains the amount ill trim is related to how risky i think the position is at current price

 im more of a swing trader than an investor anyway i do keep longerterm positions in retirement acct and dont really look at itjust let it sit and forget about it  could be small could also be over 20 like early 2022 who knows  data to support your argument  what is money market  i already sold everything   and thats the capital preservation aspect in a real world example  most of us know the technology sector better than buffett and that isnt a bold statement

he has ignored the biggest driver of wealth for thirtyish years now  just buy and hold for 90 fucking years  hes smart raising cash at high valuations 
he will probably be bailing out some large companies when the market is crashing in 618 months 
monday will see some action i believe because trump is go to use tarriffs to control the world 

but it will not happen and us will crash and burn  i will be messaging you in 1 year on 20251201 204514 utchttpwwwwolframalphacominputi202512012020451420utc20to20local20time to remind you of this linkhttpswwwredditcomrstockscomments1h49py3is_anyone_else_a_little_concerned_about_thislzxf97ocontext3

  so unlikely  did i not specifically say that it depends on the stock yes im tapped into hype stocks and have realized the returns i mentioned 

if you have a low risk tolerance fine but dont denigrate my strategy by calling me delusional 

nothing i said was wrong or untrue have fun with your meager returns  thats the definition of timing the market  thanks it wasnt so bad actually just two weeks on the couch taking antibiotics tickborne encephalitis could have been much more dangerous  its just whenever theres a serious dip like 2020 they print like crazy not even shutting down the economy could stop this market  youre the one who is missing out my friend im sure youre the same guy who was skeptical of bitcoin if you dollar cost averaged 100 a month since 2017 bitcoin  you would have amassed close to 150k even more if you started earlier  the signals are always strong until they are not  op is talking about moving from highly speculative plays which should never be a full port of your portfolio

to someone like that putting 30 or more of their portfolio into spy is pulling back but still getting market gains  and if the market dumps 10 theyre happy that spy only went down 10 so they can put it into the next speculative thing thats down 90 or hasnt even popped off yet  then you dont know what her plan was only people with a net worth over 100 million would have their unrealized gains taxed a better question is what are your plans once tariffs cause widespread consumer demand to plummet  deleted  d wave is one to watch of course ibm and microsoft are investing heavily into the space  all those 3 companies are still trading at multidecade high forward pes  bulls win bears win pigs get slaughtered  lol its anything but just because its discussed on wsb doesnt mean anything they talk about it all do some research before you take a position or dont your loss   it means its growing in popularity for good reason  i dont really know anything about ta honestly  i just know how these regards think  i dont have an answer for that because im not trying to thread any needles i dont buy what seems like a bad investment just because i feel like i need to be in the market  i suppose my question is the sp is currently at 6000 is there much chance it wont see 5400 in the next couple of years 

if youre in etfs even for the long haul it feels worth it to close your positions and wait for the next big drop to buy more  457 is not 5  naturally all ones money should not be in the market money is needed to pay bills like taxes plus an emergency fund preferably in a hysa  just google about sundar pichai and his enshittification of the product i never use google anymore its completely useless after ai its a dead product its the next yahoo ai is infinitely superior to googling

maybe google can get going with their ai or some other stuff but history doesnt prove it theyve tried a ton of things and failed at all that isnt search  risk free rate  he didnt ignore aapl  in the next 618 months we could see gains that are greater than the subsequent correction   you guys having been saying this same shit for 6 years now  lmao  the saddest and truest comment in the thread  oookaaaay  my understanding of their post was the market in general 

they then used trendy stocks as an example to illustrate the frothy market 

i did not interpret their wording as they are specially asking about trendy meme stocks are looking frothy and they should   lock in some gains i interpreted it as they were asking about the us market in general 

im a doctor btw so pretty smart right im sure my interpretation of what they wrote is the correct version  i dunno about that but it just doesnt make sense for a company that was worth 2 a month ago to be worth 20 now even under the assumption that theyre going to be on the receiving end of the trumps cronyism theyd need to scale up operations substantially to be worth that much and theres no guarantee that theyd be successful in that

as far as i understand price started surging about a month ago due to insider buys who must already have known that this news would come i imagine them partly cashing out these days  moving the goalposts are we   same thing was said back in 2021 at a similar valuation and then it corrected 80 odd porcent  eh i just wanted to say theyd pull out at 69

the ta angle is true though but ta and psychological levels are kind of interlinked so it probably is because of what youre saying  by this you mean you dont mind being in cash andor you arent concerned about the possibility of the country moving to high inflation  i see i think its possible it goes from 6000 to 5400 but i also think its possible that instead it goes up to 7000 first and then drops to 6400 and ive lost 400 by staying out until then and even if it does go to 5400 in a couple years thats a long time to be out of the market and worried that it may never drop back to where it is now the market gradually goes up so its a better default position to be in than out  oh we could easily see 4750 again we could also see 7500 before we see 4750 or we may see 5000 and then have a 20002010 sideways market or none of those things could happen and we see 10000 before falling back to 7500 

well diversified properly allocated portfolio which we keep rebalancing is all we can do and taking doubles and triples off the board when the next swing is a home run  thats okay  i saw an analyst saying that they have modelled for the sp to go to 15k because of millennials and zoomers powering the market as opposed to gen x which is a smaller gen this was on the scaramucci show he also said btc 250 this time next year  keep in mind its an election year fed has pivoted   true it was all my prev savings i still had enough to cover the basics but my bags were a bit too heavy lol  wait google about it  alphabet is also youtube they are ruining that one with ads i rarely watch it without ad filters but its still highly popular they also own waymo the only really selfdriving company i take serious search is partially dead and gemini is inferior right now although guess what perplexity is running on google still has great offerings with maps and mail their app store isnt losing money the whole chromebookandroidpixel business is baking money they have whatever is left of fitbit and nest just to name a few theres a lot of potential based on some strong income streams  wow im completely uninformed i know what none of this means time to do some learning

edit typo  buffett as i think he has stated many times evaluated apple as an appliancewidget seller that happens to vertically integrate its tech into its products not a technology company said another way apples primary business is selling products that have tech not selling tech that works on other companys products

i agree with that analysis and i would note that its an insanely shrewd observation on his part  one of buffets analysts got him into apple lol it wasnt even him
he is a goat but he has been totally blind to tech theres no denying that  winningbigly is a very smart guy one of the smartest guys i know  yeah my bad just flagging that these are still historically high pes for these companies they havent had the earnings growth  what else was happening during that period in the market im curious its almost as if inflation drove the fed to raise rates which created a market wide sell off the hardest hit of which were the growth and small caps that left a major buying opportunity for anyone paying attention it wasnt you now the company is on track to launch the equivalent of a falcon9 next summer at a pace faster than anyone else has ever done oh and theyve done this for between 2300 million 

continue telling me more about how you havent spent a second researching the company you clearly saw a post someone half intelligent made and decided to follow lucky for you you made some money this time  right this is exactly on point its guess work from 2014201 i remember lots of people were amassing cash waiting for another crash which never came if the sp500 goes up to 7000 then it drops down to 6400 people will be reluctant to get back in until it drops back to 6000 breakeven if they keep waiting until a return to 6000 it could vshape recover back to 7000 or even 7500 then the real suffering would be felt the most valuable service provided by advisors is not stock picking its psychological staying cool and not acting on fear or greed stay invested if not 100 then within your comfort level maybe 6070 ride out a correction ride up the recovery  yea its almost as if people say time in the market is the best thing ya know because its true  ok you make a good point i probably could have said the same at 5  join the ponzi but hover your finger over the sell button

and sleep with one eye open  yeah and be prepared to weigh through the first 10 results of promoted bullshit content and ai generated cruft to find out there 0 results that match your search  yes ok let me explain it so ingrates on reddit wont downvote me despite me being a literal 10 years actually 15 industry expert

this kind of search is called a navigational search its the only thing google is useful for now its called navigational because you know what you are looking for but dont know where it is its basically a directory lookup

you could of course just ask chatgpt to find it for you but it would be slightly slower

however i could also jusk ask claude to summarize it for me

do you still want to google  thats correct i have tremendous genes very smart family i come from my son is 69  really tall really strong genes  yeah i feel like if people are really wanting to act on the fear of a correctioncrash they should move the money to something less affected by that outcome but not completely unaffected like cashequivalent thats going to earn next to nothing at least if i am putting it in consumer staples it will be more resilient and i will still earn something if my prediction is way too early  yep as a user the inshittification is painfully obvious love that adding reddit as a search term is listed so true

but dont forget in late 2008early 2009 and mid 2020 there were no safe havens in the market but those were extreme periods only the most cynical are predicting that this time around  i am mixed on rddt their astroturfing during the campaigns and wide scale banning of conservatives showed some serious weaknesses in reddit

i am still a fan of reddit for communities like this but if musk gets his shit together to create a better group alternative it could dig into reddit quite a bit

also rddt went up due to google training their ai on it but google seems unlikely to win the ai game unless they buy claude or mistral which they should",0.9446,1.0,1

auto giant stellantis announces immediate resignation of ceo tavares

sunday december 01 2024 0903 pm
dec 1 afp  stellantis chief executive carlos tavares on sunday resigned with immediate effect the auto giant announced signalling differences over the future of the multibrand firm
the company which makes fiat peugeot and jeep vehicles said in a statement that the board had accepted the resignation of the 66yearold portuguese executive in recent weeks different views have emerged which have resulted in the board and the ceo coming to todays decision independent director henri de castries said in the statement",Far_Sentence_5036,2024-12-02 01:44:56,238,98,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h4ccah/stellantis_ceo_resignes_is_fired/,,"im an engineer for stellantis and this year has been one of the worst not looking good at all we keep taking shortcuts attempting to save money youll soon see with the plastic we went with for the 2025 models lmfao  shouldnt the stock go up if the general sentiment is that leadership is handicapping the companys growth and wellbeing thats what happened with starbucks  this is going to be a wild ride europeanamerican automakers are in big trouble  maybe they can raise the keep prices even more in celebration  took way to long

the hornet was a horrible idea

a basic ram contractor truck is 50k  80k jeeps for everyone  candidate for worst auto exec of all time which is quite the achievement  stellantis has provided better returns to the long term buyandhold investor over the past decade than either ford or gm especially once you factor in the ferrari spinoff  increased prices so much he tanked sales of jeepram and  dodge no reasonable person is going to spend 100k on a jeep or ram truck with the unreliability of them  how many millions does he get for leaving and running this company even further into the ground  did he resign or was he fired which is it  make cars people can afford to buy and are easy to work on problem solved  no one wants to buy any stellantis products you have to be stupid to buy any new dodgeramjeep product when there are other options out there that wont explode on you 

their only lifeline are the ram trucks which are actually good just expensive they killed the challengercharger crowd by getting rid of the v8 and no one wants to pay 6070k for a jeep wrangler  hallefuckinglujah

i own two dodge cars  i used to love their philosophy  but they have lost their fucking minds  no surprise demand for automobiles has been getting weaker weak businesses in autos are having trouble  if the board that hired him are still there then nothing was solved its the same people and they will pick another imbecile  everyone buy puts so the market makers send it to the moon and save my bag holding ass  i wouldnt buy a chryslerfiat product if you were paying definitely not interested in owning a piece of that company  us brand at least 30 of their cars come from mexico maybe that tariiff scared him off  cars are a multi faceted business ultimately the goal is to sell a ton of cars in order to sell a bunch of parts the more cars you sell the more your dealers return to you in servicecollision parts purchases this means you dont want to sell the perfect car that never breaks and if you do you dont sell many you want to sell a lot of cars that exceptionally fit what most people desire in the segment and can potentially be involved in car accidents  and you never want people to hate it right away but you cant expect a manufacturer to not want part failures there are rules for how long you have to support a vehicle you sell with repair parts this means you have to make stuff you dont need at the moment and hope you nailed it in the first place it or can keep up with what comes up no one wants to have stuff they cant sell cause no one needs or wants it 

the company is in rough shape no doubt did you know that front brake pads and rotors for a hellcat cost 4800 in parts alone at retail most fiat based platforms will make your bank account like wsb loss porn just to stay running  

they need to axe like 50 of what they have going on and they have committed to an electric direction no one else is following recently or now especially after trumps election  shares down were almost a negative territory  red market tomorrow  they are cutting every corner possible and overpriced   i wouldnt put  in anything elkanns involved in  stellantis manufactures airframes for achr   its gonna be interesting to see if big auto gets bailed out again this time  wow what the heck happened  lol these guys been getting canned monday mornings like nfl coaches  because europeans dont understand jeep brand  make jeep american again  people blaming him have no idea what theyre talking about

stellantis wasis in a lot of trouble and this guy was someone who could enact change  its one of the best ceos in the world let alone automotive


call it what you want but he wanted out for months due to the board not supporting him 


now they have a bigger problem in their hands


where talking about a guy that has nothing else to prove and more money he ever dreamed 


he just wasnt taking bullshit any longer 


the us dealership model needed to be destroyed and the prices where exactly what he was against notice the wagoneer being the cheaper suv in its range 


he was fighting for cheaper not the other way around   just like nissan maybe they only have a few years left to live this is because of tesla theyre destroying every company right now and their company is needs to be divested into multiple companies its going to take over unfortunately  ripe for a trump appointment  thanks for the info exactly why i love reddit

tavares had a great aura with investors but in reality he gutted the company to goose near term earnings and pay himself a 30m bonus last year  its not your fault but stellantis vehicles have been unreliable cheap junk long before 2025  oof that plastic switch is gonna come back to bite them hard when customer reviews start dropping as a potential buyer this is good to know  guess ill avoid the 25 models like the plague stay strong man corporate penny pinching always ends badly  if stellnatis made helicopters they would make the jesus nut out of plastic to save 2 

why are the bumpers on jeeps so cheaply made  stellantis tech here what changed and is it going to break on me more often  been eyeing the peugeot 408 please tell me if i am making a mistake  i would be very very careful many people are thinking what you are thinking which may inflate the price a little in the next days but i think this is not my job this is just my opinion that we are just another bad news away from crashing vertically even more

i would only invest what you can afford to lose without swearing too much  starbucks stock went up because they picked nichols as the ceo   stellantis has not picked anyone yet  lets see who they pick as a replacement

tavares did have some credibility  so my take is that situation is much worse than anticipated on the ground

but maybe the market is already pricing that in and change of ceo is positive news  stellantis has a very bad reputation because of the puretech motors here in france  you cant fix manufacturing issues fast like you can coffee  isnt stellantis backing achr  adds to further and wider variability of outcomes  not with a company like this which is going out of business  and what we think will happen with google think   throw in japanese if you take in account for nissan  yeah the chinese are going to come in guns blazing and take more of their market share  japanese are bad too china dominates the ev market and its not even close  or make another 800 horsepower charger instead of trying to make a modern day kcar success happen  the hornet is dumb but its also just a rebadged alfa romeo tonalehttpsenwikipediaorgwikialfa_romeo_tonale so it doesnt need to be good it was a very loweffort offering for stellantis to throw into the market  that spin off was soooo sweet  100m  yes  decided to pursue other career opportunities we wish them well  not clear in the post i think he might have resigned in other words might have been fired  a wrangler that may catch on fire in your garage at that  it is insane that you can get a cummins diesel 2500 for the same price range as a jeep  if thats their lifeline its not tied to anything solid american trucks in terms of quality and value

ford  gm  ram 

a plow guy who buys a ram is a guy struggling financially getting his front end rebuilt at least once a season  youre nuts  the challenger and charger have been stellar vehicles for the money for years

and tavares gutted their legacy  i dont see what this has to do with tesla more like their brands have been shitty unreliable vehicles for many years they price gouged during covid stopped making any affordable vehicles massively overproduced a supply and now nobody wants to buy the overpriced crap  youre right on that its unfortunate because a lot of us have great ideas and could truly make these cars amazing but the big guys just want the customers to be happy with as little spending possible 

happy to help gm has had a great year  now unreliable expensive junk  i dont want to get too specific as it wouldnt be too too difficult to find me lol but mainly referring to the interior plastics youll notice that the materials are brittle as fuck if they need to be removed for repairing there is a high chance the component will break also makes them money by having customers purchase new trim pieces etc  i sold my starbucks cuz of that and i didnt beleive in the company anymorethe stock is still flying but i am still happy i sold tho  tavares spent too much time on his portugal ranch instead of running the business

the dude got paid like 30m last year  yes over 150mhttpswwwstellantiscomennewspressreleases2024julystellantisinvestsadditional55millioninarcherfollowingrecentflighttestmilestone the last couple of years not counting the stock they bought on the public market  for real nissan is one of the few auto companies that has a junk credit rating and theyve had a ton of other problems for a while stellantis despite all their problems people are mentioning here has a much higher profit margin than nissan which is barely profitable at all  i feel bad for nissan they ate a lot of shit for their unreliable cvts in the early 10s but modern ones are perfectly fine but they still only sell their cars to people with double digit credit scores  japanese automakers are largely doing better than just about everyone else its nissan going through struggles thats about it toyota and honda need to nail it on evs for the 20262027 timeline but thats about it and theyve been quietly working towards that mark for a while with toyotas arene and area 35 projects and hondas zero and afeela projects theyll get there  i think investors and the media overall may have underestimated sergio marchionne as ceo  real knife fight out there   tesla makes the dealership problems worse though when they and other ev startups show how great cutting out the middle man and ordering a car online can be

i have zero social skills and i suck at negotiating so i have no interest in ever buying another vehicle from a dealership now that theres other options available  lol i hope companies who take shortcuts by taking the cheap way especially cutting off employees will fucking bleed of course megacaps are immuned lol  more so than usual i have a gm car and i only broke 1 trim piece replacing the radio the average is 3 the center speaker cover alone had five clips holding in essentially a piece of plastic the size of a grapefruit

i tend to put a very small amount of grease on the clips before i reinstall any trim pieces

if you have any say in the automotive industry why do the volume knobs on radios consistently go bad ive had it happen on ford volvo chevy almost doesnt matter the brand lol  i feel bad for nissan 


you should feel bad for all the customers they fed over the years


they ate a lot of shit for their unreliable cvts 


they didnt eat enough pretty much had the worst cvts on the market they should have gone bankrupt



but modern ones are perfectly fine



no they arent theyre better but still inferior quality  even if you have enough cash to buy outright usa credit culture is so odd to me  we had a 03 maximait was basically junk at 70k milesnever again  i have zero social skills

clearly youre on reddit lol  credit score is irrelevant if youre paying cash only a factor when borrowing money  it was weirder yet  wasnt that long ago that a guy who cant pay off his 60k car loans can also get another loan for a 500k house  cash matters  you dont get certain discounts with cash 

i could have bought my volvo c40 with credit and receive 1000 off  i paid cash and i didnt qualify anymore  they want you to finance because that interest dwarfs the discount for financing  glad i bought a honda in 2013 haha  the pro move is buy on credit then pay it off immediately  we bought a 2011 civic si  were cheap asses so paid 4700 bux in 2020  its got more in upgrades than the car is worth and wakes me up when my son starts it in the morning  if i could do it all over again id make sure to insist on a stock vehicle with original every except maybe the oil and tires lol  they had a minimum requirement of 3 months on finance  there was a penalty to pay off early  

not sure why i was downvoted for giving a fact about boston volvo  

i bought my volvo c40 65k cash  no need to finance and deal with fake discounts  dang they have penalties for early payment now  what state are you in in some states like california thats illegal to have loan terms like that for car loans  volvo did  nissan did too about 8 years ago when i tried buying a car with cash  i had to wait 2 months for that penalty to go away  that was worth it i think it was 3k off for financing  the downside they want you to use in house financing with shit rates instead of a credit union with lower 25 type rates  im in massachusetts",-0.9716,0.9819,-1
I predict Apple will acquire Nissan in the next 18 months,"the japanese automaker is facing severe financial challenges and may run out of cash within 12 months putting it on the brink of bankruptcy

apple with its bold ambitions to enter the electric vehicle ev market has already invested over 10 billion in rd for the apple car despite canceling the project earlier this year that investment exceeds nissans current valuation

partnering with nissan could help apple overcome the manufacturing hurdles it faced with its ev project nissan has proven expertise having produced the nissan leaf the bestselling nontesla ev of all time

the global ev market is one of the fastestgrowing industries projected to double by 2030 by acquiring nissan apple could transform its vehicles into sleek cuttingedge products that seamlessly integrate into the apple ecosystem

this move would allow apple to directly challenge tesla reinforcing its position as the worlds most valuable company ahead of competitors like nvidia and microsoft",Scorface,2024-12-04 01:36:44,0,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h5wpqf/i_predict_apple_will_acquire_nissan_in_the_next/,,"no  nissan is a burning dumpster fire  the appropriate move would be to let them go bankrupt then buy the parts that are attractive if there are any  thats the stupidest thing ive read today  they cleaned house and closed up shop  literally everyone involved with the apple car is gone  why would they now try and restart it with a dumpster fire and no in house talent  it would be a horrible decision  building cars sucks it is low margine and is incredibely suspetable to abnormal market conditions  no way apple changes their mind on cars just because nissan cant stay viable  no fucking way  absolutely not happening  didnt they sell their ev lab in china and xiaomi pretty much release those prototype as their own

appl pretty much give up on ev  this is the worst prediction ive ever heard in my life  apple doesnt do splashy acquisitions there more about the tuck ins last big one i can think of is beats but even that was small in context couple bil  apple isnt going into ev nissan is garbage  interesting i predict now that cars are just tablets on wheels the os will be mainstreamed and not everyone will have their own like when smartphones once came out plenty of cars have already adopted google os and i suspect more will too i bet apple want to throw itself into that game  to me a japanese it sounds no less absurd than uniqlo taking over ba

nissans ev cars are as powerful as the rc cars you can buy for 20  despite canceling the project earlier this year  i highly doubt it nissan is exactly where they belong apple would be wasting money buying nissan  apple would buy it for scraps if you think a premium brand is buying a low cost car brand youre out of your mind  beats is the one exception otherwise apple has never made acquisitions like this  it just isnt how apple does new product  its possible they would do some kind of partnership to understand the business better  like they did with motorola when they made the itunes phonerokr  i predict trump will issue martial law in the next 18 months  apple will acquire ferrari in 2034  crazy but interesting call  nissan has been a smoldering dumpster fire for decades  no way apple will touch it or any part of what might be left  nissan is renaultfr  think they could buy rivn instead electric car company and already has offices in silicon valley including a lot of former employees but apple historically has not played the acquisition game like the other giants  legacy ice  expertise in nev apple wont touch nissan  what in the blue hell  youre way off no way even before apple shut down their ev effort  10 billion over the 10 years was not horrendous as some claim i felt they perhaps could have considered lucid  rivian i feel it was best for apple to stop the ev effort they have many patents  knowledge from that project which do  will continue to have value review how airplay is available in most new cars  think about why  the last thing tim needs is a failing brand in a cut throat industry with literally only a few companies making worldclass margins of 10 lolol  wait and see what happens with ev subsidies in the new administration but the real question i think is this to what extent can you monetize a vehicle throughout its lifecycle  they wont cars are a low margin highly cyclical business apple was working on a car for which they would have even partnered with an existing manufacturer and still stopped that project maybe with the exception of tesla ev are a money losing business  ok i will volunteer to be in charge of nissan first id do another skyline gtr thats closer to the 34 with modern tech and a base spec skyline designed around being modded


then id fund a new fast and furious movie that is back to basics car culture and a new nfs most wanted game featuring the new gtr


make nissan cool again  the negativity in this thread bodes well for your prediction


popular sentiment here is wrong most of the time ask me how i know  i dont understand the hype around cars the automotive industry has always been a struggle high competition high capex and extremely low margins all of these is the exact opposite of what apple looks for they can probably get around the competition due to their ecosystem and get around the costs due to them making so much money already however that still probably wouldnt change the margins apple makes around a 4050 profit margin on all of their devices while car companies typically make a 39 margins on a car which is horrible because the costs to make and sell are just way too high 

imo its not efficient for apple to go into this at all and i would rather them use their cash to continue expanding their subscription services grow their margins expanding their plants into other parts of the world and continue doing buybacks and dividends for investors the car industry is a struggle and has way more potential downside with very low chances of upsides  they just need it for manufacturing they were previously going to partner with kia for manufacturering is even less premium than nissan httpswwwcnbccomamp20210203appleandhyundaikiadrivingtowardsdealonapplecarhtmlhttpswwwcnbccomamp20210203appleandhyundaikiadrivingtowardsdealonapplecarhtml   so far  rivian is a possibility as well but its gonna be more expensive the current market cap is not only 33 higher but its not in as dire straits as nissan so apple would have to pay more of a premium on top of current market cap to get board approval for the acquisition to go through i think rivian is superior to nissan from a design and software perspective but those are the core compentices that apple brings to the table nissan has a much more developed global manufacturing auto supply chain which rivian lacks given their relatively small production volume  im intrigued by the idea minus the massive portion of the investment being for an ice car manufacturing supply chain but disagree with the idea that in 2024 nissan is more premium than hyundaikia",0.8777,-0.9898,1

intel ceo pat gelsinger retires  people finally figured out qmco has nothing to do with quantum computing  welp todays the day to buy space stocks  smci lol why invest in an allegely accounting dubious company  how about a 100 gain  in the past 5 years vix has not gone much lower than its at now could be a hedge play  meta wants the 600  must be seriously mentally draining following the market every day and being angered by every move up especially as thats what the market tends to do over time you dont have to play the game if you dont like it if you want to play just accept the rules and accept the uncertainty you can get better but not without admitting when youve been wrong and putting your energy into trying to improve  maybe gelsinger was an amd double agent the way anything he did pumped amd stock  the chips are not down i mean asml  amat lrcx and tsm all up handsomely today  nice to see tavaras and gelsinger get the boot

not so sure i trust either company to make a better choice for replacement though but had to happen  aston martin ticker aml british luxury cars are now around 1gbp dropping from 45 in a few years

what happened to them does it feel like viable opportunity  tlt is getting rejected off the 50day ema  interesting  almost all sector etfs except xly opened strongly negative makes sense as fridays gains were almost all driven by retail but its broadbased right now the mag 7 is carrying the sp and nasdaq  are semis up just because of the intel ceo news seems like an extreme reaction  anyone following the other cmgcmgto

they got a big boost from some favorable articles and chris mayer taking a position 

interesting story though they make software that helps in the extraction of minerals and energy they also have been very acquisitive also they just got several executives from constellation software onto their board fueling further hope  smci has balls after missing two quarterly reports an annual report auditor resignation everybody knows something questionable happened they should admit to a little oopsie just to be believable yet here they are nothing to see here nothing at all  there will be a correction

you know how i know there will be a correction because im up 20 just in past fucking 2 monthsevery piece of shit i own is greening the shit out  that rklb pullback ive been waiting for is finally here but of course now that its here im getting cold feet anyone else eyeing it i already know ill regret not buying in now in 2 weeks  i know it works until it doesnt and all that just a little weird thing ive been doing

but i have bought next at 450 and sold at 700 4 times now in the last couple years

another weird thing i do is always set an after hour limit but for mfst on earnings release day for 96 of closing price and ive gotten that to fill several times in the last few years that has also turned out nicely for a good swing trade several times  qqq has large call concentration at 520 on both 1day and weekly expiration it would be a nice tidy profit to take an otm option  dang where does crdo think its going  im glad i loaded up on some achr puts last week im expecting this to correct back down to the 34 range in a couple of months at the latest  where are the tmdx fans  crazy according to reddit 4 years ago pat gelsinger was supposed to save intel now hes retiring intel stock price cut in half over his tenure and intel stock up 5 from news of his retirement  encouraging price action in crox i think market is realizing the selloff post earnings report was overdone given the valuation  achr puts were the move as soon as i saw the hype in here  watching all these legacy companies like intel boeing stellantis struggle to keep up with changing technology is something reading the innovators dilemma predicted this exact scenario its definitely one of the most impactful reads ive done in the years ive been investing  anyone sticking with pfe right now bag holder for a while 

current dip is tempting to buy but i feel like pharma is just such a volatile bet right now 

at the same time longterm viability feels strong  im just here waiting for rklb to drop under 20 so i can buy  apples run of late has been ridiculous  valuediv payers getting destroyed this reminds me of pre 2022  how big of a problem would tariffs on china imports be for apple anyone

i know they began diversifying production with india a while ago  we knew achr was pumped artificially but do we think it can pump to 10 in the new year  nu getting smacked down its a really solid play below 10 per share in my opinion but not sure it gets there  woa baby aapl 240 qs up almost 1 you love to see it totally healthy market  trimmed some positions today and lately in general just dont love the valuations for some of my favorite sectors like big tech fintech etc even with solar i sold the pops today for some names and took profit  hilarious to see how quickly the v dip buyers go to work protecting qqq from even the slightest of drops  everyone wants a correction and this is why we wont have one if you arent long you are doing something wrong

the economy isnt slowing down unemployment hasnt risen inflation is coming down tech earnings have been spectualor

we may not get the same 20 ytd next year but i would bet next year is going be a good year for the bulls  nebius with a capital raise involving nvda definitely should have just longed not sold puts lol up 18 premarket  can anyone explain why i have accepted limit orders to sell at x and i can see other orders being sold for xy while my order goes unfilled my broker even says the bid price is higher than what i am offering to sell this is premarket so maybe these other trades are within the same brokerage

for example im selling qqqm for 21010 and im seeing multiple bids for 2102025 but my sale doesnt go through my size is 64 and the bid sizes are 10 but still seems weird to me and frustrating  holy shit what a start of a month lets goo  is there a good site to see premarket trading chartsvolume yahoo finance seems to show a premarket chart but it doesnt update very often and nasdaq shows individual trades and volume but seems delayed my brokerage questrade basically shows nothing except the current premarket price  thoughts on gold stocks like iaum have some shares in there but havent bought recently is it better than just buying gold from a store  zs down after earnings release beat estimates for this quarter but maybe guidance disappointed  smci up 28

all of this will end so badly  wtf is happening with smci  anyone else buying rgti  anyone have any idea why rcat is down 10 today i cant find any negative news  simply breathtaking this market endlessly up with legitimately no chance of it ever going down just cannot be stopped  is there any rationale behind the disgusting pump today do we even have to ask anymore  i just dont understand how people can predict if a stock price will go down or up like how do you see the pattern and movement  terrible capital allocation i could have not fixed the company for a fraction of what they paid him

fun test replace the ceo with ai and see how well it does give white collar people a little taste of what their workers think about  to the moon alice  waiting for rklb to drop a bit more   ask those that rode it down from over 100  thats a stock nobody around here talks about

bought a decent position back in 2016 and then added to it in 2018  it has been dancing around it long enough got an upgrade to 725 today  seriously the haters need to stop whining and start hedging  people would be much mentally saner if theyve just set up some montly etf contributions people want to get rich quick like in 2020 who bought the absolute dip everyone wants that 50 crash to buy stuff for a penny on a dollar  always be learning  if thats your credo then every failure is just another chance to learn  nah they just pick individual companies to short that would go down anyways

like lmt or achr and other memes  those are all equipment makers for semis people have been posting here for like the past few weeks about how many of the equipment names are good value if you are planning on holding long term 

not all the chips are the same outside of ai compute auto and industrial markets have been lagging for the past year or so  at least gelsinger has all those bible verses hes been tweeting every day to comfort him  now that hes gone i might actually consider a position depending on who they name in his place and dont say two people  aston is cooked they are just not competitive in their market and always on the verge of bankruptcy  best hope is brand bought by chinese  luxury brands are a gamble on chinas economic rebound imo most luxury clothingbrand houses are down too  i still think december will be fairly quiet 

funds buying big tech because it looks good on the year end reports to their investors 

no one really wanting to sell a lot because of the chance of a capital gains tax cut next year 

probably not much news driving the broad market in either direction  lol pat was holding back the whole industry  the export rules debuted over the weekend they were not as stringent as feared  im closely following them but i dont have any position i would want to give up right now

i think one exconstellation guy owns like 13 of the company and they basically designed a manager incentive program mirroring the one from constellation software  if smci gets delisted the whole ai narrative falls apart and with it the broad market they couldnt have that  haha i hear this every day and it just endlessly goes up good luck getting any meaningful downside in this market it aint happening  i picked up some more shares if it goes down more ill buy more  been holding since 2021  just bought 100 lets talk in two weeks  im waiting for sub 20   to be fair youre still paying a huge premium for it you cant apply traditional metrics to value it and that personally scares me same thing was said back in 1999 and 2001  appreciate your comment  how are you gonna play this  getting a liver transplant  how feeling about it these days   not going to lie i totally fell into the trap that gelsinger would transform the company and return it to its old glory boy was i wrong what a disaster company  i dont think the best ceo run in human history couldve turned intel around in 4 years they had been and still are in a morass 10 years in the making i think broadly pat did the right moves but they will only pay off in several years for now intel continues to sink  he didnt pray enough  got close to a bottom tick so far with my swing will be curious on price action from here  boeing suffered from the dilemma of just plain up and forgot how to build planes  thats not boeings or stellantis issue  boeing is probably screwed commercial aviation wise i doubt they have the talent remaining there   at the same time longterm viability feels strong

longterm the stock is about where it was 20 years ago and before that was at this level in the late 1990s

 imo pfe is a stagnant dinosaur ive called it the immelt era ge of pharma but a lot of people see a household name they know down a lot 

the company has overpaid in an attempt to buy growth repeatedly over the years so the company gets no credit for capital allocation possibilities with the cash they have 

could absolutely bounce again but so many people have tried to call the bottom on here over the last two years and nobody has made the case why the next 5 years is going to be any different than the last 1020 there was an excellent 72 page presentation by starboard a few weeks back that went over all of pfizers many issues if they were able to get a great new ceo from outside the company id be interested otherwise something people can maybe play for a bounce but still not seeing a case for sustained improvement in the business itself  no i think pfe has a lot of pain to go through 

 eliquis and ibrance and prevnar losses of exclusivity 

 falling covid products

 no real substitute for eliquis and major blockbusters to undergo loss of exclusivity in 2028 

 severely overplayed for seagen i cant overstate this enough merk themselves with the pressure to replace keytruda walked out of a deal at a share price way below the agreed one with pfizer 

 discontinued oxbryta which was recently acquired in 2022 for upwards of 5b

 little internal growth danuglipron seems all but assured for glp1 growth

 huge debt burden from poor acquisitions 


all this screams poor ma strategy weak management and blind management shooting the ma shotgun blindly hoping to hit a blockbuster  trump is anti vaccine  i started a pretty big position  honestly just becuase they raised guidance for next year and the stock has been beaten down like crazy

but i could also see them just flaying and losing it all   having to cut their dividend and the stocks crashing to the teens then down to sub 10 like walgreens  imagine if they were actually growing well 40 pe with almost no growth could be 200 pe with growth maybe 500 pe who the fuck knows in this clown market  valuediv has been irrelevant since the financial crisis

we are in a new era of investing tech which can squeeze outside insane profits margins fast because you dont have to build factories or infastructure capex to grow

for example with software you just dev then copy and paste as many times as youd like with instantaneous delivery and insane margins

if you read the book the intelligent investor it outlines that these cycles happen and you have to reevaluate what works  actually if were talking later 2021 specifically the dowspx equal weight and the sp itself held up great into the end of the year while tech stalled out and that turned out to be a warning


im kinda thinking the nasdaq composite makes the 20k milestone but its going to be kicking and screaming lmao its felt like its been dragged up slowly  tech is div and value the entire world runs on tech even your drink water boiler runs on tech if you want to

avoiding them for the sake of diveristification is a prime example of textbook learners have to understand why they thought that idea back then and why it isnt todays reality

also never listen to analysts if they were soo good they wouldnt work for you they would be on an island retired  as they should be they are dinosaurs this is the new frontier of markets  enough of a problem that its still a problem not only that but if china does retaliatory tariffs on the us then already falling iphone sales will fall even more  sure it can but i wouldnt fancy the riskreward now if youre looking for a quick trade id look at others that havent bolted yet

i dont understand this artificial thing what does it actually mean i bought something with very low liquidity today and actually moved the price slightly if i moved it a lot would the price have moved artificially when does price not move artificially  cuz apparently brazil is getting smacked down  i own it and was so close to buying puts on it last week as a hedge   what are your positions this should be good news you should be invested in a stock market index with good exposure here everyone on reddit should be basically presuming younger age demo  thanks i bought today 7 shares to keep the price afloat  if youre investing in sp you dont need corrections with individual stocks you absolutely need one because individual stocks work differently than etfs so i understand frustration of people any tech stock can dump even 50 during a bear market where sp is usually 2025 so you might be royally fucked as an individual stock picker  im not sure that many people want it really just the ones that do go on about it a lot im pretty sure these are mostly people who invested in very conservative high dividend companies that have performed very poorly the last year or so or have been mostly sat out from the market and want it drop so they can get what they missed rather than the idea being driven by much logic 

i know a case can be made for the market being at high valuations on the whole but we can also make a case for there being a lot of value left in the market and the majority of the high value being due to shift in the big players of the stock market to high growth big tech that people probably rightly have a lot of faith in dominating for a long time i feel like this has been pointed out so many times and makes a lot of sense but some people dont seem to want to acknowledge it even if you think big tech valuations are completely wild there is still value in smaller companies

i dont know why the discussion has to center so much about the market as a whole needing to come down or go up really it made sense when we were in the big bear market of 2022 and parts of 2023 and everything was getting hammered and it might make sense again at some point in the near future but for now i think we should concentrate on just finding opportunities  i switched the orders from gtc to gtem and they went immediately so i guess that was the problem i expected good til cancelled to include premarket though  i use moomoo but you have to open an account  it depends on whether the mining company is value accretive  yeah just found this 

for the current quarter zscaler said it expects revenue of 634 million at the midpoint of guidance versus estimates of 633 million

seems like an over reaction to me but could be a nice discount if you like the company and looking long term if it holds tomorrow  not that crazy its still down over 25 compared to 3 months ago  just ride the wave man bail when things get too scary for you easy  markets trying to decide if its cooked or could rebound  george the chief technology officer announced he was leaving the company is my guess

link to press releasehttpsirredcatholdingscomnewseventspressreleasesdetail162redcatannounceskeyleadershipupdatestoaccelerategrowthfollowingusarmyshortrangereconnaissanceprogramofrecordaward  profit taking  are you the guy obsessed with the letter v  i started a spxu position that i started when spy hit 5800 and pledged to add 1k for each 1 spy keeps going up 

so far im down 10 on it  throw down some hedges then  covered calls otm puts  you short   what disgusting pump the sp 500 was up 024  you cant  you learn real technical analysis not what gets passed off as ta by amateurs  zuck had dinner with trump

think thats why it rallied  agreed my first statement was a joke i am invested in the 4 of them i mentioned for the long term  some people i know think were going to reach a local top sometime in the next two weeks sell off and rally back before the years end

well see the contrarian indicators are setting up for such a scenario id like to see them at higher extremes naaim over 100 cboe putcall below 081 before putting the trigger on any put setups  so does that mean we could see a selloff come 2025  intc dropping now lol  is that really material given new admin coming in a month  they did implement some of the csu incentive plans specifically the one where executives must use their cash bonuses to buy company stock on the open market  smci are in no way the main player of the ai boom they were just one of the main stock market beneficiaries for a short time one fraudulent company getting delisted shouldnt affect sentiment around ai much if at all the way you say this is as though it has been all hype with nothing to back it up which is clearly not true  ok conspiracy bro  were you the guy praying for nvda to turn out to be fraudulent as well or was that someone else  my concern is that now so many people are convinced with this same mindset its usually when the tables turn  i feel like this is just a single day pullback the last earnings went really well so a 1 day fall of 10 on no news screams healthy profit taking on a rising star for me with the sentiment of the last earnings still holding true that this stock is going to continue upwards

source my gut feeling i hope i wont have to eat my words  its both qqq and iwm

 qqq december 3rd 520 strike 5k in calls 
 iwm december 5th 246 strike 8k in calls
 iwm december 5th 248 strike 7k in calls

buy a december 6th contract for qqq one expiring next week for iwm make sure the size is very small the jolts report may disrupt the normal price movement you may want to run a 0dte strangle for iwm instead  not gonna be able to afford it after this  nike has a new ceo gifemotefree_emotes_packthinking_face_hmm  tbh i feel like its a self feeding vicious cycles unless the ftc comes down hard

these companies are profit money making machines huge profits little to no competition zero debt amazing balance sheets attracting the worlds best talent

why would you invest in anything else  good point interesting the market doesnt seem to care yet  that was clearly the turn  yeah looks alright to me maybe something more subtle or just someone with a lot of shares wanted more

i was getting an error trying to reply to your other comment about dell for some reason so ill put it here

i remember you mentioning this ai seems to have been a fairly consistent strong point with very good growth you could argue that it may have reached its local peak but doesnt make much sense say that the sentiment is going to drop like that must be based on the idea that the ai rally has no substance or has gotten way ahead of itself but that doesnt look like reality to me probably will happen at some point but i dont think so yet it looks relatively rational to me

on the other hand it seems possible to me that the pc market could start to pick up pretty soon might not be advancing as fast as it was but stuff does still break and need replacing fairly periodically plus you can still get a fair bit more for your money than you could a few years ago maybe some sort of ai hardware advancements for personal computers will become more sought after as well  thanks  yeah after theyve run so much its not surprising companies like rcat umac rklb etc are taking a dive  you know it  wrote dump instead of pump by accident  do you have any books you recommend that talk about that or any resources really  you never know sometimes lol yeah just one of my gripes is when things get lumped together when there is some nuance  i could see a top happening before year end probably around opex in the 20th 

im sort of in the no big selloffs before year end group 

still confident in the general prognosis either way im not particularly excited to initiate new longs unless theres a short term catalyst coming  poor intc thats brutal  whether or not the rules matter in the long run is irrelevant to the shortterm reaction of the market this is why smh is mooning today  it looks like its a little different from csus program though seems like cmgtos bonuses only partially need to buy company stock  one the latest reports we got around capex spending was like dell which saw their general ai market grow like 50 i dont remember if it was yoy or qoq but there is still growth there

however the company still missed revenue goal due to weakness in like the pc market  are you referring to me merely pointing out some weird accounting red flags and somehow turning that into me saying nvda is a complete fraud  no its the mindset you need to have the mistake is thinking otherwise and missing out on great gains  ueggplant_parm827  is correct just look back at any of the big correctionsrecessions of the past 2 decades you can barely see them wehn you zoom out the graph you are right that there will be a correction its inevitable it is just foolish to try and time it perfectly if you dont need the money in the next 23 years staying invested is the best play you can make  wow thats a lot on money in contracts haha thanks for sharing is there any reason you dont just wanna wait for the jolts report to reconsider also would it be fine to just run a qqq 520 december 6th call only  tmdx  turning shareholders into customers  exactly i dont see anything taking tech down in the near term 

it certaintly wont be legacy dividend stocks 

it will be some future tech play or other disruptive tech quantum space gene editing etc  joe the other commenter makes a good point but its also worth considering that foreign phone saleshttpswwwredditcomrnewssrulwu5i0d9 of which the iphone is dominant have fallen 44 in china this year already so maybe its that its already fallen so steeply that theyve already been expecting a reduced market  it might be because if you sell apple for a lot of those people they have to buy something else to stay invested so they might prefer to wait until there is actual proof apple earnings will be bad before selling  as far as the zs move i always wait until the market opens to really care too much around ahs pricing 

however if i was long on the company there is no red flags imo and im sure the stock will bounce back at some point 

yeah i think the fear with ai is still the overall roi companies are spending a ton and we dont really have much to show for it yet i personally think there is better roi in machine learning over pure llms 

with the pc thing thats what i think a lot of the street is thinking around ai demand for devices since a lot of the compute still happens on cloud there is work trying to get into the device itself i do think we are due for a pc upgrade cycle soon since a ton of people upgraded during the pandemic but that was about 45 years ago now which is aligns with the normal upgrade time 

at least for chips a lot of the markets have been basically flat or down outside of the cloud compute stuff its been a bad market for industrial and auto chips  im enjoying the ride up as will i the elevator down its the cycle of life markets  they arent v recoveries they are checkmark recoveries

cause after a tiny red we get waaaaay more green and go well above the previous levels  normally youd have to be a cta or cmt to have the theory and practice together you cant just look at candlesticks you have to have the whole package volume analysis atr mfi avwap etc and know which collection of indicators apply to what stock

a good starting point is technical analysis 2nd edition by charles kirkpatrick and julie dahlquist  if there was a book that could teach you how to predict the market nobody would work  truthfully it could occur as early as tomorrow with the jolts report or the trade deficit on thursday when everyones piling in at the same time it only takes one bad piece of news to create a selloff

i initiated some new longterm positions last week and this morning  i just sold a bunch to avoid the wash sales rules because i expect the dip after the new year and will be hunting  thanks im still in the early learning phase on this one  the market will likely move overnight in anticipation of the report premiums are already starting to rise before the day ends you dont necessarily want to guess the direction of the movement  bad news might be interpreted as bad news good news or no news  and you can always close early if the result is benign

yes thats fine  china is giving foreign phone manufacturers some serious competition between xiaomi oppo and huawei i can see apple and everyone else continue to slip rapidly there  youre describing me 20 in aapl thinking about trimming and invest in another overvalued mag 7 amzn  yeah fair enough i just find it interesting to see the reaction to earnings partly because i like to bet on the moves sometimes but the immediate swings do seem to be often quite random unless theres something very surprising in the earnings release  we have seen some pretty strong reversals when the market opens lately so maybe youre right could be better to ignore ah most of the time

you could definitely make the argument that companies are going overboard with their ai spending but then on the other hand the companies that are doing this have a lot of cash and people are hoping for growth and it does seem to be the best bet kind of building the infrastructure right now and only time will tell how well it will pay off as with any investment but seems like a pretty reasonable bet to make to me on the whole seems kind of similar to me to when big tech was betting on cloud computing when that was newer i know ai isnt new by the way before anyone picks me up on that i suppose with the ai there is more risk and a lot less certainty on the revenue that it will generate though compared to cloud computing

like you say with chips and ev stuff not performing that well this is partly why i just dont see the market as being in this absolutely crazy place that some claim there is a lot of tech stuff left that will undoubtedly see a big increase in demand at some point but people are hesitant because the results havent been that good lately its not the wild euphoric market mindset in my opinion even some stuff that are fairly big players related to the ai space have taken a beating like asml and amd  very true the v sounds better but youre correct  the basic components behind a successful company have been known for almost a century yet the average retail investor barely beats inflation on a yeartoyear basis   oh definitely i try to preface with unless something big happens 

im mostly convinced the market doesnt want to sell yet unless forced  makes sense appreciate the explanation is there any reason you didnt just buy december 6th also isnt this generally considered very risky running a call with so little days to expiration do you persoanlly believe qqq will reach the 520 strike or are you just riding the move up and exiting  oh no doubt about that however the retaliatory tariffs if they come would hardly help  literally the strategy is to just invest in overavlued mega caps 

investing in undervalued lagging stocks has been horrible 

what a weird time to invest in 

thinking google is a good deal meh forget it invest in tesla isntead way better gains  i cant believe some of these prices its hilarious aapl 240 tsla 350 pltr 67 fucking hilarious  and yet the majority of professionals who do study the basic components behind successful companies also struggle to beat the market over the long term   well retail doesnt want to sell insiders have been selling furiously and piling up cash  december 6th for iwm the increase in the premiums are too high to run a strangle more than a day or two out and time decay makes it dangerous to have expiration so close to the putative move 

the setup means that the market maker will buy shares to delta hedge as qqq moves towards the target price the etf has shown reliable momentum since november 15th as well putting the odds in our favor  and it will look cheap when aapl is 300 tsla 500 and pltr 100 i mean why not name any fantasy price will probably get there since stocks only go up with no downside risk  ironically this is partially due to them coming to mimic the spy in their portfolio construction throw in pressure for quarterly performance eroding margins with hedges and so forth very limited stock selection etc  and its not surprising

the problem is structural incentives not knowledge they sabotage themselves in ways that would not occur if they were not managing investments as a job  oh retail is in euphoria mode 

the amount of posts bragging about gains in november are nuts  sorry i meant for qqq i noticed you played december 3rd  i hope shit gets that expensive gonna be sooooo much money to be made on the way down  by that logic these professionals should be filthy rich in their own personal accounts then even if their performance at work is limited  this is decidedly not the case  window dressing on buying the biggest outperformed at quarter end to make their books look better essentially makes these clowns buy high and sell low  you should buy the december 6th contract for qqq with the anticipated move occurring on december 3rd if the underlying doesnt move you can exit with a slight loss  do you have any short positions  serious question for you whats your take on googs current valuation  do you have evidence of this professionals dont share their books the ones i know personally do very well  ohhh gotcha so thats when you think the move will occur thanks  nope just sgov and eose and waiting to turn that sgov into something else with better risk reward than a 27 forward pe spy  the only fairly valued company thats even tangentially related to tech or ai 

but i fuckong despise them for making youtube unwatchable and i am an idiot who refuses to invest in companies i hate even if they are good value  every single research study ever done has shown that there is zero evidence that anyone including professionals are able to predict what the market will do  if there was truly some secret to investing surely it would have been discovered and studied by now over the last 100 years  but honestly the easiest way to know this isnt true is because if they really did know the secret to investing they wouldnt be working a 95 as stock analysts and fund managers",0.765,0.9999,1
Does AVGO is rise count as a gift?,"since october 2024 broadcom has underperformed many of its technology peers as investors have rebalanced their allocations to the semiconductor sector

despite the recent relative weakness broadcom has remained in line with the sp 500 demonstrating stability

broadcom expects ai revenue to reach 12 billion in fiscal 2024 accounting for less than 25 of total revenue

custom ai chips are at the core of broadcom is ai revenues accounting for up to twothirds of the total driven primarily through partnerships with hyperscalers such as microsoft aws and google

customized chips are expected to play a more important role over the next five years helping customers address ai cluster scaling and cost challenges

broadcom is leadership in the networking market could be challenged by nvidia which is capturing the market with more competitive networking solutions

broadcom is growth in ai while promising is still a low percentage of overall revenue from ai

weakness in the nonai revenue segment could undermine the markets bullish confidence in broadcom

wall street is constructive on broadcom but future guidance needs to remain strong to maintain market confidence

broadcom is forwardlooking peg ratio of 169 is attractive compared to the tech sector average of 189

i think attention needs to be paid to the companys execution in ai and potential headwinds in nonai businesses

on balance broadcom stock is under shortterm pressure but the longterm bullish logic remains in place for investors who are optimistic about ai growth prospects

broadcom is longterm growth potential remains with its ai business and custom chip capabilities i think it needs to be cautious about ai revenue expectations and pay attention to the performance and future guidance of its nonai business",pregizex,2024-12-02 20:57:13,1,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h4xhj3/does_avgo_is_rise_count_as_a_gift/,,youve analyzed it well my friend  the ceo blew billions on vmware a dying software company on top of that they broke all existing agreements to make quick profits customers are fleeing vmware like crazy  with the help of ai we can do better  you mean chatgtp4 analysed it well  lets see what happens this week lol  hock only cares about the top 10 of customers he doesnt care about those that are small and flee also dying hardly might want to read up more on vmware and hock tan   it would have been a much better deal of broadcomm acquire qualcomm  honestly chatgpt grammar would be better than this  maybe she didnt use the paid version,0.9776,0.9796,1
What do we think about IOVA?,"firstly congrats everyone on rklb achr and lunr gains it was fun ride i have to be honest i had jumped off the wagon a bit earlier but hat off to all of you that mooned 

also for some of you that jumped on zeta enjoy the good days that await 

but lets talk about iova

another biopharma stock trying to solve the issues of cancer an industry that is a holy grail for all pump and dumpers out here 

but is this one different to be honest i do not know but that is why i am posting this to hear other sides other points of view 

iova is currently sitting around 9 these are levels of before the this year run to 16 what goes up must come down when pumped and dumped however this company reported revenues 9086mil revenue to be precise granted not enough to support current market cap but bear in mind it is bio industry we talk about it takes 1 approval and it is too late

leadership
ceo is there since 2016 seems like an experienced guy was contributor to many oncology drugs already developed and approved

others seem legit as well this post is already too long feel free to research yourself

they also own a bit less than 12 so there is certain commitment there  and of course the vanguard black rock etc are heavily involved as well more than 87 is owned by institutions 

amtagvi product got approved by fda and that is now generating certain revenue they plan tk get approval in canada europe and uk as well 

they also work on ln145 iov4001 and iov3001 but lets be honest these are long shots and nothing guarantee success of these

i know these are speculations and putting some numbers from the future is no way to go but i feel like i have to just to make this post a bit more complete

potential yearly revenue if approved broader and if nothing goes wrong  is 12billion amount of people with cancer of specific type  cost of treatment but realistic values at beginning is 12bill per year or even less 

and then for all the gamblers time that with moon if other drugs get approved as well 

company with 90mil revenue and 80 million of debt with 28 billion market cap and 440 million of operating expenses company with future on the moon or in the sand do you hate iova or you will become a bag holder 

please share your opinions",Heg96,2024-12-03 01:43:23,0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h54hmj/what_do_we_think_about_iova/,,"doesnt seem like bio tech is hot right now especially with post election news being focused around ai ev and space i think pl is a better short term play and they have earnings report next monday they will probably run up and sell off after earnings just like asts nov 14th and rklb nov 12th


edit i have never been a big biotech guy to begin with though so i definitely have a negative bias to it  i have a big position in iova in one of my accounts and am holding for the long term 


theyre the only company with a fdaapproved til therapy product and they also have their own manufacturing facility  


approval for til therapy is coming in 1h 2025 for canada and the uk so there are a lot of catalysts for 2025 and beyond


check out the page on stocktwits lots of good info posted on there regularly  9 seems expensive 

youre purely looking at speculation so id rather it below 5  man  of all the stock discussions and financial chatter i see on reddit and online i hate seeing biotech pushes the most with a burning passion  i think it is important to understand that amtagvi from the point of view of the sales is not going to work in the same way of most drugs

amtagvi is that expensive for a reason you need to take a piece of tumor from the guy get the lymphocytes and then develop the patientspecific version of the drug to do this you need time people and facilities

it is not a drug that you can ramp up as fast as you want with gross margins of 85 where after commercialization the only limit is the demand in the market or the size of your sales team  theres a class action lawsuit against zeta now  copied press release 
the law offices of frank r cruz announces the filing of a securities class action on behalf of zeta global holdings corp zeta investors

heres a summary of this article
zeta
1272
the law offices of frank r cruz announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired zeta global holdings corp zeta or the company nyse zeta securities between february 27 2024 and november 13 2024 inclusive the class period zeta investors have until january 21 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion

if you are a shareholder who suffered a loss click here to participate

on november 13 2024 culper research published a report alleging that the integrity of the companys data collection and reported financials is severely undermined by two factors first the report alleged that zeta has formed twoway contracts with third party consent farms wherein the company simultaneously acts as both a supplier and a buyer of consumer data allowing the company to flatter reported revenue growth and indicating possible roundtripping of revenue second the report alleged that zetas collects the majority of its customer data from a network of sham websites that hoodwink millions of consumers each month into handing their data over to zeta under false pretenses for example the report alleged the company and its subsidiaries operate a number of fake job boards which are designed to trick individuals into submitting personal data under the pretense of job applications the report further alleged that the companys most valuable data comes from these predatory websites dubbed consent farms which are responsible for almost the entirety of the companys growth

on this news the companys stock price fell 1046 or 3707 to close at 1776 per share on november 13 2024 on unusually heavy trading volume

the complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the class period defendants made materially false andor misleading statements as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the companys business operations and prospects specifically defendants failed to disclose to investors 1 that zeta used twoway contracts to artificially inflate financial results 2 that zeta engaged in round trip transactions to artificially inflate financial results 3 that zeta utilized predatory consent farms to collect user data 4 that these consent farms have driven almost the entirety of zetas growth and 5 that as a result of the foregoing defendants positive statements about the companys business operations and prospects were materially misleading andor lacked a reasonable basis

1589 views  good point industry hype is very important short term  market cap is unrealistic i agree and by looking at numbers it is overpriced but then again the whole market is  that is so true like i said it is scam field but just wondering if there are exceptions  yeah its risky to buy a biotech companys stock when the company is not profitable yet but iova has the only fda approved stage 4 melanoma treatment on the market right now so this is at least different than a not profitable biotech company with no fda approvals 

also its possible they get fda approval for other solid tumor cancers 

i am long iova  but then again the whole market is

thats more reason to stay away   hard to trust any bio or pharma right now when the next admin could torpedo the entire regulatory process i need more stability on that  hahaha war chest it is   we gotta find the biggest  going",0.9948,0.9828,1
Seeking Alpha Black Friday Sale,"is it just me or does the seeking alpha black friday sale seem extremely unremarkable they raised their price from 239 to 299 a year a few months ago then when black friday comes they make the sale the 239 price what a deal eh

i recently got wsjbarronsmarketwatchibd for 7 a month yahoo finances free version is basically seeking alpha lite fastgraphs normal price is what seeking alpha is charging as their sale price

what caused their inflationary pricing to go up so much for seeking alpha importing tech from china increased midwest farmers crops went bad and they jacked the price up

their subscription price has doubled in the last 3 years to me it just shows they have no problem giving their customers the middle finger while taking as much as they can from them 

what gives thoughts",Vaporzx,2024-12-01 18:13:04,68,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h42h3k/seeking_alpha_black_friday_sale/,,"do people actually pay for subscriptions in this space not trying to start an argument genuinely curious

i donate a few dollars a year to marketplace on npr but thats about it  im chinese it only costs 12 dollars a year to buy seeking alpha membership on taobao in china  i cant believe anyone pays for sa it offers absolutely nothing but opinion pieces written by amateur investors you can do the same research by perusing the comments of financial related reddit forums

sa is a fun site for discussion and little else  i hot the barronwsjmarketwatch bundle for 4 bucks a month ago  i think a lot if not most black friday deals are something similar where they raise the price before and then drop the price on black friday back to the normal price  i would pay money to not read seeking alpha  i have seen so many companies do that they raise prices and then announce sale events where they revert back to selling productsservices at the same price they were not long ago its super shady and one of the reasons i dont buy into the whole black friday deals anymore i highly recommend everyone to do their research before buying  seekingalpha has a really nice user interface best of any app ive found not saying it justifies the price but its good  tradingview black friday is the best deal imo  is seeking alpha better than motley fool  i tried to post twice in this sub about their alpha picks service which is on sale for 400yr but stupid mods removed it anyway i was asking if it was worth the money  i got all the articles except for some premium articles free for several years and about 56 months ago it was no longer free  not sure what changed or how i originally signed up for free  i dont miss it and now when they send me emailed updates i just delete them since i cant read the linked articles  still looking how to quit the sign up i did many years ago  i tried a few times but if i cant find it in a minute or 2 i just leave the web site i may just identify their emails as spam and let the email program block them  i use seeking alpha stock quotes and graphs which are free also google finance a quick and easy way to see stock performance for 1day 5days 1month 6months ytd 1year 5years 10years and max  seekingalpha is the only one i continue paying it helped me find app and 10x returns  i got seeking alpha premium recently and it is pretty incredible ive yet to come across a better website it has so much information and topquality research if youre serious about investing and want to keep up with the markets and trends i highly recommend it  not saying i ever do thisbut it makes no sense to pay for seeking alpha when you can just turn off javascript and bypass the paywall  they can charge more because their loyal subscribers know they are getting their moneys worth  i make many times more on strategies using their quant ratings then the cost of the subscription  you dont need any of those subscriptions just free stuff is enough including yahoo finance  ive always wondered are the articles on there helpful  removed  i use market chameleon and its worth the 100 a month for me been using it to find good stocks been crushing some good calls lately but who aint in this market lol  seems like all the apps are doing something sneaky like this  havent really used the site since they put everything behind a paywall i used to read the free articles when that existed but i wouldnt pay for any of what i read  try stockopines newsletter black friday deal instead  i just use yalls subscriptions  overpriced  my friend wants to go half and half on sa is it worth it lol  hard pass on sa  i would never pay for seeking alpha so many well respected investors release letters for the public to view for free  not worth 1mo  i have very bad toots after thanksgiving eating  seeking alpha is super trash i think at this point you can google them posting 2 opposite trades at the same time one bullish one bearish then reposting the one that works as part of their win rate  i bought a 2 a month sub to wsj  mw although im not sure how much its actually helped me most of my ideas have come from random places podcasts etc  i got a free year of fool once and it was basically pointless i was surprised at how little unique intel they offered  this is the way

listen to marketplace on npr  read real news articles  

dont put too much credence or trust into places like seeking alpha or motley fool  some people got rich selling shitty courses and stuff on discord so yea people pay money peoples fear of missing out is easy to prey upon if you are a dipshit  right i use several free sites that are good at different things and get the entire picture i cant justify paying hundreds of dollars subscription for a dd to save several minutes  300 a year is nothing when my portfolio is growing by 20k a year it is a lot of money for a subscription but that site offers all of the information i want to see about a company in one easy to navigate place in 15 to 30 minutes i can learn the revenueincome trends what events caused prior share price declines and what analysts and individual investors are thinking is happening or will happen going forward 

if i was able to research stocks full time i could probably get a good feel for 5 or 6 different stocks a day by using their interface ill admit i have not used any other site for research though so i dont have any comparison there might be better options out there  2 dollars a month for wsj is way worth it  i pay for bloomberg because i read their articles everyday and enjoy the opinion pieces you have to support journalism one way or another  i alternate between paid subs to wsj or bloomberg would like both but they are kind of expensive along with wapo nyt and some local papers important to distinguish between actual journalism and whatever seeking alpha does  some do but i wont be exploited if i see a value at a fair price then i will 239 for seeking alpha is exploitive

i havent heard of marketplace on npr before but ill definitely check it out  look at this guy  asking the real questions  i paid for tradingview essentials its just a nice tool to watch all my stocks  after hours development on my ipad casually depending on the size of your depot its basically peanuts also the ibkr integration is quite nice  theres an arbitrage opportunity in here somewhere lol do you have access to american articles as well i generally avoid seeking alpha so i have no idea what is on there  can you help me with getting it   i agree im learning from this thread that there are people who value these opinion articles thats a lot of reading time for a lot of noise 

for me a service has to be information positive to justify itself on my subscription list id rather spend that money on data streams i guess  seeking alpha also has industry professionals that have been in the game for 20 years its not all amateur shitters  tons of stores around the us are doing the exact same sale they were doing and have been doing for the last few months

saw a video where a target shopper pulled up the black friday slip in the plastic holder only to reveal a sale where the tv was the same price looking online by sku number the tv was the same price at other places with no sale as it was at target on sale  yes way better just make sure to go back and check the analysts older work to see their track record  no  it has been worth it for me its crushing the market  for me the most valuable part of seeking alpha is the comment section lol  its written by bloggersinvestment firms each with their own opinion   for seeking alphas profits yes for your retail investor no  if you pay for sa its same level as reddit  i bought it last year on a whim never really used it  motley fool gives out thousands of recommendations per year and then they go back and only highlight the stocks that did well  idk why youre getting downvoted youre totally right i havent found another app that has all the information i need to know in such a concise ui

i share a login though so im not paying full price lol  where do you see 2 a month the subscription price shows as 2 a week for me  literally anyone can write on seeking alpha if they pass the editorial team its basically crowdsourced journalism so quality can be unreliable  i dont mind paying that price it can pay for itself easily with just one good investment  eh theres approximately one author who validates my biases so it is worth it for that i also pay for bloomberg news and get some mileage out of that too not bad pricing for financial entertainment  of course we see the same website and the same article  theres some but even a majority of them are trying to scam you into an investing group or subscription service for 100s per year on top of the sa premium sub and i would bet the information youd gain access to by following them wouldnt be much more beneficial than having me a nobody share my portfolio updates with you

its all a money making scheme bro theres no edge they can give you that you cant gain from buying and holding index etfs or a basket of dividend aristocrats investing the smart boring proven way always wins out in the long term  i love the comment section   well that sounds like itd be all over the place   thanks you saved me a search was just contemplating on fool services  even on the mobile app all the information is just as easy to get to its fantastic 

i used the site for free for years but now they only allow you to access a few articles per month in a free account in september i decided to bite the bullet and just pay the 300 a year  in canada its 50 cents per week

The defense Sector - Can those Earnings be sustained in peace times. ,"t hasnt made it to the white house yet and hes already cleaning house and arranging furniture meeting with heads of state as if hes really running things hes lucky elon is right there next to him doing the heavy lifting to make things more  efficient

it got me wondering about the defense sector the pentagon has failed every audit for the last several years which leads me to believe all these defense contractors are getting kick backs off the books but also their contracts might be over inflated and they taking advantage of uncle sams check book because he doesnt really know what hes signing off on

its possible the dept of justice might sue them to pay back their corrupt pricing over the years

the other factor is jan 20th inauguration day trump clearly said hes not paying a dollar more to ukraine so that means billions of dollars is no longer going to flow to the bottom line hezbollah and israel signed a deal so things are staring to look more peaceful zelensky said he might be willing to make concessions on land to make peace

so the question is are defense contractors overvalued

i just dont think theyll be able to sustain earnings like the last two years the spending will drastically slow",Euro347,2024-12-02 20:51:57,0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h4xd4y/the_defense_sector_can_those_earnings_be/,,"frankly your thesis is flawed from the start if you think trump entering office means peace times are coming good luck  i would add that preparing for war never ends even in peace times you are doing upgrades maintenance and serious rd to prepare for future technology maturity in all likelihood we will need to spend more to incorporate ai and the technology of today into tomorrows weapons as well as restock older supplies that were used in ukraine  preparation of wargrowth


beginning of warzero   so things are staring to look more peaceful

if this is what you think peace looks like

but also trump pushed military spending when he was in office last time 

httpswwwbbccomnewselectionus202054060026  last time trump was in office we saw a massive increase in us bombings across the middle east i would expect more foreign intervention and thus defense spending under trump  assuming trump somehow stops all war using his bad spray tan powers


these defense companies will spend at least the next 4 years building weapons to replenish worldwide stockpiles


remember kids they dont just make stuff for the us market the eu is also depleting their stockpiles on the ukraine thing  israel needs a boatload of replacement sams etc  also europe is increasing defense spending due to the unreliability of trump  removed  history says otherwise  bombing the middle east is an american pastime since the reagan years  operation inherent resolve began in 2014",0.9748,-0.154,1
German market - Volkswagen,"i started investing in stock market around 8 years ago and at that time i only did that through my bank in my european country time passing and all these broker apps did it so much easier to invest in stock market and nyse seemed so appealing that i totally forgot about other markets the last years
so here i am today checking german market and specifically volkswagen and i cannot figure out why is it so much undervalued i mean look at this ebitda and cash on hand
is there something i missing of do you think trump can hurt europe that much did whole europe stop investing in european countries do you think that german auto manufacturers dont worth their value 
whats your opinion about this",dipster23,2024-12-01 10:46:25,61,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h3vzop/german_market_volkswagen/,,"removed  no this will be very difficult the far too important china business is running out and vw still needs about 2 years until they are on the market with a competitive ecar platform at the same time the price war is ruinous and the cost structures of vw are not comparable to for example chinese oems the strategic pivot to the us market has been even more questioned since trump the only downside for me is that vw is better positioned than any other volume manufacturer however the car industry in general and volume oems in particular are low in margins the only german manufacturer that currently does quite well is for me bmw  the fall of german automakers has made headlines all throughout 2024 

for vw in particular they are looking to close some plants in germany while fighting resistance from unions

workers want a payrise

their labor costs are much higher than other european automakers at 154 of revenue compared to the 95 to 11 for mercedes bmw and stellantis 

at 66 per hour germany has the highest labor costs in the world
usa 44 per hour and japan 24 per hour

their luxury brands audi bentley and porsche saw declining revenues only lamborghini revenues increased

they are losing in the eu ev market of all places with tesla and chinese evs outselling them

they are losing market share in china they are closing china plants as a result

they are losing their small market share in usa

i wouldnt invest in vw i would want them to separate their best assets divest porsche macancayennetaycanpanamera  they should stay with vw and be rebadged porsche should just sell 718  911 divest lamborghini thats their only growing businesses  lamborghini and porsche sports cars  i dont know much about the topic but if you just look at the profit per car you can kind of understand what is wrong with the industry


you are selling these massively expansive cars and you are making like 150 per cars  and since you are already massively invested you are forced to produce big numbers of cars per year  and if your car dont sale you are toast  you cant cut the price because you are already in thin margin  or if you are forced to cut price you end up lossing money massively


just look at nissan news today    lots of problems with ev sales in germany not selling as well as they thought also energy costs are too high in germany so lots of companies are actually going bankrupt or leaving germany  pressure from eu emissions regulations fierce competition not a lot of room for growthinnovation but theyre a massive company and theyre gonna be around forever so no harm in buying if you dont mind holding for years  german economy is in really bad shape and tariff trade war with china will end really badly for german automakers  they sell most of their cars abroad and build them with imported chinese materials theres a reason they wanted to avoid them i would stay away  i have been holding vow for a good 2 years and 3 months i lost faith in the company lately closing factories down and decreasing the net profit by 50 is no joke also the entire german car manufacturer ecosystem is sick 
as well vw used to be the best seller cars in china which is changing rapidly which will hurt vw deeply 
also they still need to invest a massive amount of money to develop a profitable ev business that will hurt even more their margins 

there are much better opportunities out there to make money  volkswagen cant sell cars they are even giving 50 discount in china inventory is piling up they are closing down at least 3 manufacturing locations in germany i wouldnt touch it  1 cant sell evs

2 german economy slowing 

3 need to cut costs by 17bln and have a heavily unionised workforce which will make it tough

4 highly politicised situation too state of lower saxony has seats on supervisory board

5 price competition from china 

will be a few years before its sorted so i wouldnt buy just yet

see what fy figures turn out to be  unpopular opinion but it brings me joy to see all these companies that turned their backs on loyal western customers to chase chinese dollars slowing getting pushed out of china

i wish it happened sooner and i hope it continues to happen for some time the suits need to learn there is a penalty for screwing over your customers  latest 30 drop is on me i looked at their numbers and decided it was a good investment around 6months ago i plan to hold for 10 years by then dividends should have payed for the shares and hopefully they will have rebalanced on their market share  probably best cars ever made shitty stocks  in my opinion vw streamlined their products too much and while that helped at the time basically every brand they touched transformed it into another vw with a different badge specially the interior and whats under the hood and charge prices solely on the image that brand built before their cars are very expensive to maintain due to the backwards engineering that frankly doesnt improve the car that much to make you go through all that hustle the only difference i noticed between audi and a vw is sound insulation everything else feels relatively the same and people dont feel like theyre getting more value out of more expensive cars their parts are expensive even if you want to do the work yourself and nothing is straightforward compared to bmw or mercedes people now care more about reliability and cheaper maintenance since most brands offer decent functions audi a3 starts at 33k euro and dont even come with auto dimming mirrors  some good nuggets of information in here if you think about the car industry as a whole vw has long been the good quality car choice for the average european and german if you want a sporty car you get bmw you want a luxury car you get mercedes you have money well there are options why good quality because german technology gave their engines an edge 

with the movement to electric vehicles there is no combustion engine ie vw has no edge compared to other cars they tried to sell their evs in china but they cant compete the chinese cars are coming to europe and have a cost advantage too bmw mercedes and even audi can at least justify some of their price with more features luxury sporty techy whatever vw is in the mass market

less demand for cars with combustion engines other car makers are also catching up as well i see a lot more skodas and volvos in europe right now and low hopes of competing in the ev market 

the german economy is really struggling right now they are reducing costs wherever they can and i can imagine that companies are reducing their b2b deals with the car makers germany will always be the biggest consumer of german cars 

vws business model just seems to be a victim of the changing demands of consumers  volkswagen might not exist in ten years time  youre basing the value up on past stats not forward outlook 

theyre struggling laying off thousands they will not be innovating much in the next decade german software industry is archiach and cannot keep up with rest of the world even without china the self inflicted damage by germany puts a cap on most large german oems i see this first hand in my line of work its not an ev problem nor china problem its a germany and vw problem exacerbated by these two 

tread with caution

id wait until policies and company strategy updates next year i dont think this is the bottom yet  shorting opportunity at this point   volkswagen is now out of the electric car market in the us for right now they were going all electric by 2025 which didnt work out id4s werent selling uaw is now at vw and i predict that plant will move to mexico eventually i think vw closed two plants in germany and i heard from a  friend that works there that they reduced the employee salaries in germany by 10  never really noticed this stock is it any good  its my largest holding i think its super undervalued  car industry is never a good business to invest in just too much capital is needed  vw got destroyed in china and now china is opening factories in all continents to finally destroy vw  deleted  deadest of dead money 

in fact germany might be non investible in my opinion  car stocks in general are uncertain for me because the governments dont want ice cars while the people dont want ev cars until they pull back on this im not touching them  debt tho   i think the entire autos market is going to screwed for several years german auto makers are extra screwed theyre so far behind the curve 

one german company ive started positions is bayry its involved in too many important industries and the german government will need to support the company as a means of the countrys economic survival  i would rather gamble my money into rivian or invest in toyota than buying any european car maker let alone volkswagen who used to be a big player in china but has lost its edge completely now  there are talks that china can buy out vw also vw been slow with evs also they had too many bad rep as of last few years this means prople dont wanna buy this shit  thanks this was very informative and agree about the importance of protecting jobs  i thought only the us could deduct taxes on stocks and never looked into it can you explain how can an european investor use the tax deduction  well put vw slept on the change in demand and they were too arrogant to react they are 35 years behind    i totally forgot about other markets


this 


take any sector a leading us company in that sector will always be better off than a nonus company therere just too many reasons for this to list out but top 3 are easier and cheaper access to funds larger market better business climate


from investors point of view vw bmw merc stock valuations will be compared to ford gm not talking about product quality or market perception of cars and if one has to pick ford and gm are better stocks by valuation and risk  chinese automakers arent outselling vw in europe from q1 to q3 2024 theres only a single chinese model in the europe top 20 the mg4 see herehttpsalternativefuelsobservatoryeceuropaeugeneralinformationnewsseptember2024europeanelectricvehiclemarketresumesgrowth the chinese arent currently as strong and significant of a force as many people claim although that may and likely will change

vw is in trouble currently because theyve lived very well off the chinese ice market but since you basically cant get an ice vehicle registered there anymore the consumers are buying evs unfortunately vws ev lineup while decent really doesnt appeal to the chinese so they lose sales in china the europe sales are fine although vw obviously has higher ambitions when it comes to ev sales

the workers arent going to get a raise theyre laughably overpaid already in a german context to the point where many people have little sympathy with them

vw needs to get it oversized bureaucracy and managment overhead in order focus on quality software experiences and lower their prices to gain market share 

the car industry as whole is having a hard time right now its not unique to vw theyre not going away having said that i wouldnt touch their stock  all good points energy prices are also a factor and even if the war with ukraine ended tomorrow the future of energy prices is uncertain  so you want them to rebadge the already rebadged cars that doesnt make any sense  i hate vw but this crisis is just temporary im sure  you think theyll keep distributing dividend  value trap territory very ballsy  im so sorry for you 
i dont think they will make it back  sorry for your loss  lol  every eu country has different tax laws so i cannot comment on that i am based in germany  they were a bit taken aback by dieselgate too  ford is terrible  i have been bagholding too long  there is no growth  a decent dividend if you got in at the right time but thats about it  any time the stock shows some progress a big recall that costs them billons will drag it back down  their evs have been a failure and are now back to the drawing board to hurry out hybrids  they are so far behind the other car makers  source i am a direct supplier  thanks for bringing it up vw is not doing too bad on evs in europe as i thought

that said just as mg is chinese not british volvo cars is chinese too  why wouldnt you touch the stock give little more insight please  yes i think volkswagen made an extremely questionable move

it would increase porsches brand value by focusing on their strengths

why are ferrari and hermes doing the best versus other luxury

because they dont dilute their brand by increasing short term revenues by targeting another class of consumer

nothing stopping ferrari from milking their brand in the shortterm destroying it longterm by putting their badge on affordable suvs  yes they make a lot of money pe is under 4 but dividend will probably be reduced i hope they keep some extra money to eleminate debt lower debt makes the investment safer and should save them money on interest long term i tend to like companies that reduce their debt load as they make money because its an indicator that they think long term and that they understand healthy financials are important  thanks  are they developing full hybrid  were comparing it to vw so no growth or minus 8 is still an outperformance to negative 28 ytd of vw congratulations you just outperformed by 20 ytd  true both volvo and polestar could be considered chinese in this context  i dont think they make a lot of money and thats the issue they having now and are forced to cut plants and staff theyre heavy in debt and moving forward theyll cut dividends at all in an attempt to recover  the 2025 explorer was supposed to be full electric built in oakville ontario plant  all the tooling was made and near production  apparently there was major issues with the drivetrainelectronics  now its being delayed 2 years and redesigned for either full hybrid or phev  im not sure which way they are being tight lipped about it  even my friend who works in engine division there doesnt know  they consistently make a profit and the stock price means that i can buy that profit cheap sure profit is down and that sux but there is still profit and personally i like their cars both ev and regular they are reasonable cars at reasonable prices i did buy in too early but i still have some faith in the company and my investment i am also tempted to buy more but i have a set of rules that govern my investments and they prevent me from putting more money into that company at present  very interesting news i asked specifically about full hybrid because here in europe as well manufacturers are rushing into it to bring down the average co2 emissions of their cars starting doing electric cars from scratch seems like a huge headache for most old manufacturers  the automakers like ev because its cheaper for them to make as many components are eliminated  no more oil pumps valves pistons engine blocksetcbut the battery techinfrastructure is still in its infancy  i think the explorer ev is available in europe but it was a different version compared to north america  hybrids are one step towards lower emissions  my friend has a toyota cross and gets 4l100km  another had a honda accord and gets about the same fuel consumption  yeah the explorer ev in europe is basically a rebadged volkswagen id4 it took forever for the assembly line in germany to start so many issues and now of course the car is already outdated and theyre planning many layoffs they replaced the ford fiesta assembly line for the explorer volumes are really not the same  ford is so silly  the fiesta was probably a good seller as well  the factory where ford was going to do the explorer ev was building the edge and lincoln nautalis  not big sellers but steady  they shut the plant down to convert to ev  now the plant is being converted again to build ford super duty trucks and people will have being laid off close to 2 years  the government and ford was all happy to push the ev movement but not quietly shifting back to a gas guzzler truck which is ford bread and butter vw is having same issues they backed off on allon on ev and pushing phev  they need to keep working on ev tech that is the future less costly  phev are cool but its just adding more crap to a ice  i personally dont like phev theyre powerful yes and can in theory get good mileage but theyre so flawed in real life use",-0.4979,0.9984,-1
Curious what everyone in this sub thinks of MSTR?,"opinion varies by sub  they guys in mstr think its going to pump like crazy soon im just curious what you guys think as stock and trading experts

we all know michael saylor has been stacking bitcoin like crazy and its a leveraged bet on bitcoin but any opinions are really valuable 

thanks",No_Tangerine_283,2024-12-02 16:01:14,0,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h4s1wf/curious_what_everyone_in_this_sub_thinks_of_mstr/,,"if you buy mstr youre paying a dollar to buy 30 cents worth of bitcoin  buy it in the bear market not in the bull your to late to the party right now  a ponzi scheme

why would you buy the stock of a company whose only goal is to purchase an asset when you can buy the asset itself   they guys in mstr think its going to pump like crazy soon

go to any stock specific subreddit and all youre going to hear it how great the company is  slots are that way  wsь  i know a tulip when i see one  doesnt mean you cant make money off it  just know one day its gonna sink  lets seefrom the recent lows bitcoin went up roughly 5x and mstr went up roughly 25x but yeah mstr is going to pump soon definitely hasnt pumped already  ive made quite a bit of money with mstr and coin over the past 10 months in my opinion stay away from mstr both really your riskreward of buying is strongly skewed to risk at this point

theres no fundamental reason for mstr to have the evaluation it has its just been fueled by cryptorelated speculation which is why i bought it because i expected it however  crypto has boom and bust cycles while it is currently in the boom phase the bust typically comes quickly when it does i would expect mstr to bust as well buying bitcoin is not a business strategy  i truly believe we are a few iterations apart of mstrs convertible bonds creating a shitstorm like 2008s credit default swaps  could pump to 1000 or dump to 100 worth buying if youre young and a gambler  boomers dont like it and neither does cramer thats all you need to know  not a scam but an unnecessary premium cost to purchase the stock while attempting to profit off of bitcoins returns

doesnt even make sense at all given the priceassets they manage 

buy btc instead  mstr is borrowing billions at 0 interest through convertible debt offerings to buy a asset appreciating at 50 a year to simplify things they sell a out of the money call option and if the strike doesnt hit 4 or more years later depending on the particular terms of the bond the buyer of the bond gets the principle back 

the companies buying the bonds short the stock after the bond is bought so they dont care which way the price of mstr stock moves they just want it to be as volatile as possible because they can make money each direction

 the bonds are the best performing bond on the market when compared to most other bonds that are guaranteed to have a negative real rate of return it becomes a pretty good deal many people will hate mstr but look at these companies alternatives buy bonds that pay out 5 in a currency expanding at a rate of 7 a year 

this is why i like mstr because the alternative for most bond buyers is to take a guaranteed loss every time some people will still say its a ponzi without really knowing what the word means do you really think the largest insurance agencies in the world would dump billions into a crypto ponzi they are smarter than you and have spent more than 15 minutes doing research  i had a look at what services they provide aside from buying bitcoin they dont seem to do anything much of substance or significance id rather buy btc directly  ponzi  saylor has already lost billions before hell sure as fuck do it again  michael saylor makes bill hwang look responsible and bernie madoff seem honest by comparison  mstrs core business is getting overshadowed by its bitcoin holdings its tough to see real growth without bitcoin keeping up  i think the next recession will be caused by the collapse of mstr  mstr is equal to 23 times more than bitcoin mstx is equal to 46 times more than bitcoin if you dont buy bitcoin directly and want a higher bar mstx is a better choice  on paper it seems irrational but its just market forces mstr went up because

1 2trillion bond market wants btc exposure

2 many european countries btc is basically illegal no etfs bank will close your account but you could still buy mstr for btc exposure mstr is still the closest equivalent to an etf for these accounts

3 you can put mstr in european or foreign retirement accounts

4 as it ticked up in valuation from buying btc with all this capital market has started to price in sp 500  nasdaq entry this means mstr has access to even more capital

5 saylor is quite bad at timing his buys but it doesnt matter because btc is up a shit load since he tripled down on buying it

6 irrationality and traders buying momentum due to recent price moves

so ive got 1 factor that isnt ideal point 6 and 5 that are still true i think if you arent european or investing in retirement accounts or running a bond or pension fund then mstr isnt for you but it trades based on the underlying so your opinion on mstr should be based on your opinion on btc most of reddit hate btc hence the sentiment knocking around mstr doesnt need to have fundamentals or do anything special providing exposure to bitcoin is all it needs to do  thats a good investment of you willing to wait for a year or two microsoft and windows on arm will be something  my avg price is 129 and im planning to sell once it hits new ath  just search the board  it is discussed daily  a lot of uninformed people here no surprise ill throw a bone

1 mstr can go into your retirement accounts tax free gains unlike owning btc yourself this is especially useful for people not in america

2 last year the book value of their btc was 15b after purchasing some more this year it is now 40b do you see how this number can continue to go up  its going to pump like crazy soon  deleted  if we freeze in time for eternity you are right but they are purchasing more at the same time the price rises  this kind of ticker it is lot too late or early it might get doubled from here easily or goes down 50 too  im really into bitcoin but i agree with you that it makes no sense to buy mstr when you could just stack sats yourself  all the risk of bitcoin plus buying it at 300 premium and having the overhead of a company with staff and other costs on top

sounds amazing  how is it a ponzi scheme

why would you buy the stock of a company whose only goal is to purchase an asset when you can buy the asset itself

personally i buy and keep my crypto myself but for less technical people its not that accessible people might want to hold their assets in tax sheltered accounts that dont allow crypto  because he is actively raising money to purchase the asset

look at how many btc they had last year and how many they have this year  i second this  why do you think that  and reddit doesnt like it either seems like a trifecta of near success  hearing mstr has debt free bonds to buy bitcoin when there is an incoming trump admin is all i needed to know  saylor is shorting the entire financial market  i dont believe you will sell  mentioning retirement accounts on an international subreddit is not a reason to purchase in scandinavia where im currently settled i have to tax around 3784 on capital stock gains no matter what whereas btc would classify as a forex and therefore go under a taxation of 22

and okay they took out a loan and now have 40b in btc but the company is worth 90b while their strategy is based on getting returns off btc itself youre paying a premium for absolutely no positives

you can literally go btc and gear it with 3x it would be equivalent in theory with a 3x hedge guarantee but mstr is a 3x premium without the guarantee of a 3x hedge on profits

how do you explain that  if you believe in bitcoin buy bitcoin what is the point of owning mstr shares

personally i try to avoid superstar ceo companies

if i want indirect exposure to bitcoin i will buy blk or ibit  this argument is straight up delusional so youre hoping for the next person to pay a dollar to buy 30 cents worth of bitcoin when mstr issue shares so that your current ownership goes up slightly youre basically taking future buyer premium to divide to existing owners what does that sound like  its not the only double in this market though not about to chase the trade  tax free retirement accounts  and why would you not buy an etf on bitcoin

how is it a ponzi scheme

self explanatory really  so if the asset price drops not only is the company down the loss of asset price but it also is in a hole of debt that would induce bankruptcy unless the asset price goes back up  let me ask you again why would you buy the stock of a company that buys the same asset that you could buy yourself and the company is raising debt to fund those purchases  so   im being sarcastic  why not  early 2024  15b btc 30b market cap

late 2024 40b btc 90b market cap

early 2025   

late 2025  

2030    tax free retirement accounts

in the uk and other parts of the world you cannot buy btc etfs mstr is your only option  alright buddy we see btc going to 1m a coin we like the stonk and its in our tax free accounts thats all ive gotta say  true i just pointing out one cant predict in certainty on which direction this ticker will move at this time  there is an etf what does that have to do with anything  good point i guess using options on mstr is also a valid use case  why would you not buy an etf on bitcoin

theyre not available everywhere and mstr existed first we cant buy usdomiciled etfs in the uk for example

self explanatory really

not really unless you mean all of btc which is not clear from your posts  tax free retirement accounts  some people love diluted shares

microstrategy has diluted its shares to raise capital in recent years since 2020 the number of outstanding shares has increased significantly with reports of an 8385 rise over three years this was primarily due to continuous stock offerings and convertible debt strategies used to fund its aggressive bitcoin purchases and operational needs for instance in the past year shares increased by over 35 indicating substantial dilution  i know im being a little dickish but the fact there are people who read your post and didnt immediately see the sarcasm is alarming  ooh haha good  hes basically saying there wont be a new ath  so their marketcap is now even higher compared to their assets than previously this is not a good thing when they cant consistently make money off the asset continiously by just holding

this is not your moms retirement account this is the stock market a place where people pay premiums on companies that have strategic implementations to make continiously growing cash flows why the fuck wouldnt you just you btc itself  i wish i got in early on a ponzi too bro  if bitcoin price go up a bit the convertible bond never happened  and it is actually beneficial since you are leveraged a bit

if bitcoin price go up a lot the bond is converted to share  so in the end you are buying regular bitcoin for 3x preminum for no reason  

if bitcoin price tank  it is actually quite dangerous because you still have debt  and the value of the company could go close to 0

actually quite interesting what the company is doing  i think the main thing is mstr convertible bond price is quite high  672 by 2029  if the price go up that much  no one cares everyone is rich  many countries such as the uk cannot buy those etfs mstr is the only way for tax free btc exposure  yeah i get it but i just want to hear the reason why he thinks that there is a pronounced accumulation of capital by institutions in both btc and mstr predominantly analysts project that btc will ascend to 100000 by the eoy such a milestone is anticipated to be followed by a corrective pullback nevertheless if btc attains this projected value it would concurrently precipitate a new alltime high ath for mstr i am not saying that subop is wrong  i just want to hear his take on it because to me its a clear bullish flow and trimming the position now would be a shot in the foot  i started investing in them at 20b market cap when their btc was around 10b so i paid double their book value for btc can you believe that i paid 1 dollar for every 05 of btc unbelievable right

well im kinda glad i did that because now you see their book value btc is worth double the marketcap that i bought the stock at 40b

are you starting to understand yet one day not so soon they will have 90b in btc and so on

source 300 ytd tax free  the trick is getting out early  im already up 300 we believe the price will go to 4000 thats roughly a 10x from here to a 1 trillion marketcap we like the stonk  and how are they able to buy the btc they issue debt debt has to be paid back either as cash or convertible to stock they dont make money when btc starts dropping again they wont be able to issue debt to keep buying when the debt is then to be repaid in cash because the convertible price wont hit where does the money come from

why do you think mstr is basically only able to issue debt and buy btc during massive bull runs why werent they buying as aggressively when btc was down 75 at 1620k its because they couldnt issue debt and they have no money  try that on all your investments and see how itll end up your argument for mstrs valuation is that you bought it made money and thats why its worth purchasing

a lot of people have done that with way way way way more stupid shit mstr is not a waste to invest in but at the current valuation it definitly is

yeah your take makes a lot of sense please remind me about your investment strategy again when im finished with my masters in quantitative finance in june next year  i am not giving suggestions  i am only giving fundamental analysis  i dont know if stock will go up or down  0  yes the current valuation is certainly bad i agree if we freeze in time for eternity today equity is typically forward looking though

enjoy your study although i couldnt imagine thinking im some kind of big timer because im studying a degree thats a little funny i imagine by the time youve finished your degree ill have made 7 figures with my mstr shares maybe i can employ you as my personal fry cook after your studies lets see   i know our fundamental analysis is we think nation states will start adopting it we think it will go to 1m a coin we think mstr will be the largest holder of modern day gold we think mstr will be a trillion dollar company we like the stonk  lolare you under the impression that 0 means they dont have to pay back the principal",0.8911,0.9994,1
difference between splitting large companies by FTC/DoJ  and collaborating companies,"not sure is this is just obvious and a stupid question but my confusion arises from the recent demand to split google example selling chrome or android i understand this antitrust cases keep happening like i think it happened to microsoft some years ago but cant google sell its parts to a friend and still have continued access to whatever is needed

for example musk seems to use x data to train models of xai even if they are separate companies or uses tesla employees to fix x stuff or spacex stuff it doesnt seem like the government stops companies from collaborating 

what am i missing here  ie by ftcdoj splitting wont it just be a minor hiccup

Do you think Rivian would make it to $100 a share?,with talks of rivian saving vw california keeping tax credit for rivian and not tesla ev drivers turning in their teslas for rivians the 35k rivian coming out next year etc etc do you think its wise to buy a few hundred shares currently rivian is at 12 a share which is low ,CoolTomatoh,2024-11-30 09:37:50,237,486,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h3465k/do_you_think_rivian_would_make_it_to_100_a_share/,,"just because a stocks share price isnt relatively expensive doesnt mean its low be careful with that mindset  i work for canadas largest railway and in the last month ive seen loads of rivians coming being unloaded never seen one until a month ago and now the storage lots full of the them  they wont reached 100share simply by manufacturing cars 

they will need to license some softwarebatterytech or something  i dont know but i saw a rivian r1s at a store in iowa and that is a slick looking suv  sure seems like having the ceo of of a rival company working as the shadow president might be a massive risk  i definitely hope that it does one day im in for 1500 shares been holding since early 2023 off the crazy dip

heres hoping they know something we dont in the third quarter they reported a loss of around 105108cant remember they missed projections yet are keeping their targets cant remember but i think arkund 46k vehicles for any other company that would be considered promising

i believe they just announced a loan from the doe for around 6 billion or at least a promise this is going to support their construction of new plants in georgia still 3 years before it opens i dont think the doe would give that type of commitment off of hope and prayers 

i would look at why canaccord gemuitu has maintained a buy rate apparently they have good reasons

edit canaccord genuitydumb ass smart phone touch lol  unless rivian and vw can figure out how to make an electric car for less than they sell one neither will be in business much longer  it is a fine car except low volume is not what the investor hoped  ill venture to say rivian hits 4 before it hits 100  rivn makes a good product and i believe the r2 and r3 will have huge sales  however rivn hasnt proven they can be profitable  00

no  lets put the thing on numbers 

rivian has 1 billions share outstanding and 11 b market cap 

rivian needs to do 1 billion net profit for having eps 1 and a pe  10 

rivian finished 2023 with 53 billion profit the last quarter they lost 16 billion 

if rivian keeps going in this way they will disappear that is the reallity that rivian is facing at the moment 

  
for going to 100 they will be around 100 billion market cap that would be 25 times volskwagen market cap so i tell you know forgot about it the price now is around fair price for me and that is taking in count massive growth next years  call options would be your best bet on that highly improbable gamble  lol good one   im a big rivian fan  the vehicles are sharp  they are everywhere here in the ne  imo they have the clearest road ahead with 0 real competition in a small normal looking ev truck or suv  can they stay afloat long enough  can they avoid a catastrophic mishap  can they leverage more oems to work with and kearn from the way they did with f  there are certainly risks  and i dont know about 100  but i feel like its the safest long term ev play since tesla  i think the investments and doubled down investments in rivian will be tripled down to see them make it through otherwise it spells great trouble for more than just rivian and their seed investors however i dont think rivian will be a formidable ev auto company in the market anytime soon but then again the market is irrational that being said 100share would be crazy for them since theyre just a luxury adventure ev auto company and basically not much more sure they had the amazon delivery van deal but aside from that they dont currently  generate enough organic demand from the market to sustain the prices of their models especially at the volume they need to produce them in order to achieve profitability  my issue with rivian is their market cars are depreciating assets and while sure most americans are morons with their money most americans also know they cant afford a 80000 ev if rivian can release a desirable vehicle that isnt garbage for around 30000 a year then i think you see a big jump in valuation but until then it just seems like premium product limited to a premium audience  not with musk in charge with that little doge thing he and trump made up hes about to fuck every competitor in any market hes involved in  lol all the woke dumbasses trying to hard to make tesla less popular these people really have not to much going on day by day  based on the number of rivians i am seeing on the road in the last 12 months shows californias are saying fu to elontesla and buying rivian

not that it means a lot but in general ca purchases often sets an example of what you can expect to see be purchased nationally the following year

by that logic rivian will be something watch close and a buy around this march for me unless i see and hear a reason to pick it up sooner

it has a lot of upside and if it looks like it will meet or exceed its 2025 projections then i will buy as much as i can get my hands on  based solely off vibes have to imagine a lot of people who hate trump will never buy a tesla now however trump could possibly pass laws that are solely in favor of tesla too not sure how but im sure elon is going to try

i see rivian cars everywhere in california now but that doesnt mean theyll ever be a profitable company  im a big bull if you model out rivian actually making it dcf would put todays price at 3050 the current price heavily discounts the risk of rivian not making it when r2 finally ships the georgia factory has broken ground and rivian can show consistent gross margin positive sales this stock likely will be trading at 100  that is a pretty generic question could it reach 100 yes there are scenarios but they would be many years away or the result of a favorable acquisition ie not a fire sale do you need a 10x return to warrant investing a few k  they have made moves in the pay few quarters that made me think theyll be around long enough for r2 to see daylight ga factory operating but r3 and 100share feel like dreams now  100  i pay more attention to market cap than stock price when considering a future price youre basically asking do you think rivian would make it to 100b market cap its very possible if they continue to make great cars people buy them they get market saturation etc etc so big mountain to climb but could go there i have an r1t i absolutely love it and the company culture and i can tell you from first hand experience they are making on the ground efforts to work out inefficiencies and in a very smart way  the way elon is about to fuck with that company  that would make it over 100b valuation thats same as byd toyota and ferrari is around 80s and most others like vw or ford is around 40 i really doubt 100 but if they get enough volumes which they might id imagine 40 50 bn which would translate to 40 per share if youre very bullish  no it would be foolish to invest in rivian when their rival tesla has a personal seat next to the president  no car company will get to 100 tesla is just also a car company and that bubble  will burst someday   yes rivian can become a 100 billion dollar company  everyone i have talked with thats owns a rivian is absolutely in love with it  the r1 just won topgear award r3 just won esquire design award  

rivian is the second company in the western world to build software defined vehicles  just create an alert that triggers if pelosi buys it  just buy in and keep adding over time dont go crazy full portfolio type of shit keep your risk manageable  12 means nothing its a 125b market cap for a company losing billions each year how do you think thatll work out  no theyre literally riding the thin line  i would even doubt they are able to hit the promised price and delivery date for the r2 coming in 2026 not exactly next year at 45k there are so many unknowns between politics and inflation that committing to a price that early is a huge red flag no ceo  rivian ford or tesla knows how much parts are going to cost them in 2026 the fed barely knows if its going to need to cut rates in january 

the cheaper car is for 2027 and im sure they added the maybe non existent ev rebate into that price 


lets say ca does give rebates to only rivian and theyre able to somehow pass that in court you think the stock with just keep doubling with 49 other states not milking their  state tax payers to cover for a federal refund copycat  no  they will when they reverse split no chance otherwise  not in next 4 years  absolutely no
i dont see enough demand for rivian products and next year will be very difficult year for rivian  top signals breaching their heads  i bought 70 shares  10  i bought some shares two days ago im hopeful for the future but hard to say cause arent they losing money on like every car they make  matter of time  just because theres a lot of rivians on the road doesnt mean the stock is fair value  they have yet to make a vehicle that turns a profit  no  as long as they meet expectations grow revenue and expand in the ev market theyll get to 100 if you like the company and are confident in their future i suggest buying leaps for exponential profits  after a reverse split or two sure  while im a large rivian holder its comical you think rivian will be coming out with a 35k car next year lets get real  they still lose money on each car without counting overhead with the tax credit being killed off idk how anyone can see this as a servicable investment been holding short since 30 i can still see it go lower  no but i think they can get to 20 over the next 12 months which is a huge return but with a huge risk too  love seeing rivians on the street but the charging infrastructure for evs is still not solid even in california tesla pushed home charging stations and they are not ridiculously priced i hope i am wrong but i think they may lose momentum for a while  intriguing i just started seeing them  ill say very likely no but if yes it will take a faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr longer period to get there than most people today would have the patience for and for everything to go all sorts of right over years if youre looking at where it was and asking if it could get back there the question imo is whether it should have been there in the first place i think they were lucky to be able to raise the kind of money they did at that insane valuation  i own rivn and think it has a lot of both upside and downside potential  its just too early to tell but if it can be a top 3 player in the ev space long term i think we will see a 10x market cap increase over time whether that time will be 5 years or 30 years im not sure

also i stiffes suggest always consider market cap not share price  10m 100m 10b you want to know how many shares outstanding  it makes a difference in terms of whether youre getting a fair deal or not

rivn  12b market cap
tsla  1t market cap
lcid  6b market cap
f  44b 
gm  61b
hmc  39b
stla  38b  i wanna believe it i like the products and i still have a reservation on the r2

but this stock had been in the single digit before if you think 12 is attractive and the company is still bleeding huge amount of cash and profitability is nowhere in sight

i used to have 1000 shares but eventually sold it all the world is littered with companies that put out wonderful products but never make a dime in profit  the r2s and r3s will be the catalyst if the market likes those rivian will be selling everything they can build because the prices are pretty attractive if nottheyre going to need a recovery plan they cant exist on 100k ev trucks and delivery vans infinitely  vivek ramsey just tweeted that he will be reviewing the grantssubsidies given to rivian during the biden administration

i agree with you and bought some but then i saw this tweet and it has me worried

your thoughts  elon is messing with rivian in his new government role  absolutely

the firm is a case study in product focus

theyve focused on their product to the degree other large mfgs want to use it and in vws case partnering with rivian seems to have saved them a lot of money given their previous efforts and failures

it is my belief that a product centric focus will naturally lead to market share customers really dont care if youre a full blown nazi or whatever if the product is a step change better than alternatives it will sell

i think thats why elon keeps reacting to rivian news he knows that the market share gained by rivian will be his loss and that his product no longer holds the step change  this company had an incredibly weak start and that was before the worlds largest electric company ceo became the first lady this stock is a great short candidate  sure hope so  100share  100b market cap which would make them the 3rd largest car company in the world can they become the 3rd largest car company in the world maybe but they wont do it by just selling cars ev market is competitive as well as going out of style and while im an investor in rivian im also realistic  they are debt laden with over 6 billion in debt they are losing money steadily do they or will they have a product that can significantly increase their market share tesla is always the example people give but tesla has done well because they were early but now the electric market is full of choices every manufacturer is making electric models now which makes it even harder to break in and gain market share 

for rivian they are going to have to continue to take on more debt andor dilute with more shares but they have delivered 42k vehicles so far this year 47k total last year it would be shocking if they made it to 50share so i would  think 100 a share is just never going to happen  i own it through amazon  idk they just had to get 6 billion loan from the government to finish a plant not a good sign but what do i know stocks make no sense and the price will probably go up  rivian is so speculative to me  they are losing so much money on vehicles  you have to believe they will get that sorted out and be able to scale the business to even invest in this company at all

if you think this is the next tesla you are wrong  energy business ai autonomous robotics on top of profitable ev business  rivian has a chance to survive i guess but i wont go much further than that  just my opinion  it was when i first bought it   some one might find a way to pump and dump it  then you will have your 100 a share price to make your dream come through  no i dont think so rivn will be closer to going bankrupt than it ever going to 100share  the problem with rivian is 2 fold

1 they build cars at a gross loss

2 they live in the same market as tesla

and before people start saying but teslas didnt make a profit for 16 years this is correct but at the same time wrong for 2 reasons

1 tesla didnt have to compete againsttesla

2 tesla has never and i repeat never sold a car at a gross loss even in 2012 even not considering ev credits

and the last point is the one that everyone is really missing about evs  for tesla it was just a problem of scaling for rivian lucid and every other western automakers the problem is that you are building a product that is structurally unprofitable

to become profitable you have to change the culture and engineering of the company literally the hardest thing for a company to do

and you have to do this in an environment where another company is making 20 profit margin has no debt is faster than you has more experience than you and its creating the product  robotaxy that will make your product obsolete  yes buy all the shares you can you wont regret  nah elon will put a stop to that  two people i know got rid of their tesla and bought a rivian   cause of politics so theres that  easy  itll take rivian expanding to more than just an electric auto manufacturer for rivian to hit 100 in the near future its going to have to show some impressive software capabilities too and maybe some unique battery technology i do believe theyll hit 100 eventually i have accumulated a few shares that ive been buying for the past 3 years on a recurring basis as well as a few leaps betting that there would be at least two solid domestic ev producers with tsla being the other once all is said and done also maintain a small stake in byd  the company would be bankrupt if it wasnt for vw and amazon  no they dont make money evs are money laundering tools  rivian will make it to zero dollars a share given the incoming administration and the fact they lose tens of thousands on each car made  rivian is a loser of a company it has never been successful they should shut down car manufacturing and become an it company   maybe in 58 years they need better marketing prices and ti make profit  rivian saving vw

you do realize that vs is more than the usa right 

in the eu one out of every four cars sold is a vw group automobile  not with musk owning the us government he will do his best to prevent any and all potential competition to his empire  and elon musk doge chairman is filing a lawsuit against the loan that the us provided for rivian careful powerful people playing games  vw is hedging their bets with scout  reddit everyone is selling tesla and getting rivian 

real world rivian 2024 q3 revenue is 35 lower than 2023 q3 revenue  no 50 much realistic if they get pumper musky on board then 500 is possible  id be concerned with musk having a position in government he already said theyre going to be looking into the tax cuts they received and if they were appropriate  isnt it safe to say you cannot compare to a company like tesla that had al of elons ventures wrapped up into an inflated share price while also being a weird cult meme stock rivian is just rivian all they do is auto manufacturing safer to compare it to ford  yes  california dont have that money btw unless our boi governor levy gas tax to 6 per gallon while the rest of us get below 2 when the new digging operation open he would not last long  i dont believe theyll make it to net profitability so not really no either going bankrupt or get bought at a significantly lower price than 100 per share  sub 10 is my buy zone  there is only one tesla like it or not rivian just isnt a cult like tesla  musk will do anything to stop rivian

elon musks doge partner vivek ramaswamy says theyll scrutinize 66 billion biden loan to tesla rival rivian

httpsfinanceyahoocomnewselonmuskdogepartnervivek131329979htmlhttpsfinanceyahoocomnewselonmuskdogepartnervivek131329979html  chinese tariffs should play out well for rivian nac standards make it more appealing partnerships with vw should help

amazon delivery trucks in time will all be rivian  all these facts are there but this stock doesnt seems to go 100  this ev market has lots of players nissan news of cutting production and ford is not in good shape as well  elon is going to do everything he can with his new government influence to tank rivian  they are already talking about investigating current government loans to the company  no  they just got big money for their factory from the biden administration so its worth keeping an eye on  selling cars is not why tesla is valued the way it is rivian would need some serious progress in self driving ai and other monetizeable software  rivian is an auto company that hopes to make money some day it is not tesla  in short no in long absofuckinglutely not in my opinion rivian has no future unless they can actually sell their own vehicles theyre not a holdings company the stock price isnt going anywhere based off their dealings with vw if they cant sell their own vehicles then theyre going nowhere but down they had a cool concept for a truck but theyre selling it for 70000100000 who the hell can afford that theres not enough people interested in electric overlanding who are also rich and like rivians its such a niche vehicle they cant sell it to working men families construction companies etc because its too expensive and doesnt suit an everyday need 

these are just my observations on a surface level take it for what you will  unlikely  rivian hitting 100 per share is a big jump from where it is now the company has challenges like losing money tough competition and needing to grow fast it has potential but getting to 100 will take a lot going right its a risky bet so its good to stay balanced with other investments  government picking winners and losers apparently government has picked rivian to be a winner  i dont think so  they got a long ways to go for that to happen  living in canada and im a truck driver i see the rivian suv daily now based in ontario btw  isnt rivian like among the worst in reliability and struggling financially

edit just checked depending on the source jt has roughly a 50 chance of bankruptcy in the next 2 years and most are saying 2025  i would say no i think a good way to estimate its potential is look at an established global companys market cap and compare to theirs mercedes is 60b rivian is 12b so mb is 5x or so than rivian so 60 is realistic 

obviously stocks dont necessarily work like that but i would think the 10 year plan could approach that market cap rivian has a long way to go to get to mbs market penetration too  elon musk is gonna use the white house to squish any real competition to tesla they will be lucky to still be a company in 4 years  litecoin ltc  maybe in five years if they get their act together  i got my one share betting it will go to 100share  with musk in a position of poweri dunno  elon is going to do everything he can within trumps government to destroy rivian  yes after the 10 to 1 reverse split  if theres a short squeeze s quick make some technical analysis dd so the apes can throw their paychecks to pump em bags 

thats before rj decides to fire up the stonk printer like ryan cohen adam aron and mullen did  its a long way to go  for me i buy stocks in the products i love and friends and family want for themselves done deal i buy a hold i dont get swayed by good or bad news for me its all about the product and vision  there are many companies that have become examples of bad management when i have to name one rivian is the first to come to mind were talking about a company with a negative fcf of 15b over the last 3 years which would probably have gone bankrupt had it not been for the volkswagen deal and the loan announced this week lets not forget the insider trading on these two pieces of information which should have remained confidential before they were officially announced 

the ceo had the audacity to state that they were maintaining their guidance for the next financial release namely a profit its a lie at this level this company is overvalued and we hope it will reach its true value close to 0 a share  if theyre extremely successful in the next 5 years 60200b would be a reasonable valuation depending on level of success that would mean 60250 share price basically company is worth 12b right now which feels like a bargain based on the upside hard to imagine them totally collapsing after the vw deal but even if they dont do well seems hard to imagine theyd drop below 10b so looks like room for it to run imo  uhm look at lucid and ask yourself the same question great vehicles but  i bought it at 119 so 12 is relatively low ywsyls  a better question is do you think investors want to put 88 billion into rivian which is what it would take to reach 100 a share  when you look at rivian dont think about comparing it to tesla compare it to stocks like ford gm hmc these are actual car brands and will give a relative feel for how that market does which isnt great and pretty flat becuase it isnt an ever growing margin sector of retail more like the opposite where the margin is shrinking and they are finding more ways of making money like through parts sales but the weakness of parts availability has been clearly exposed and the entire industry has taken a hit from it better to invest in something like copart where they make money on used salesauctions rather than trying to build a brand from the ground up look at copart or carvana although i personally think atm carvana is the most overvalued stock on the entire stock market 

if caravans market cap is what the stock value says it is they would need about 20 million cars on hand in inventory for their numbers to make any sense their current pe is a hilarious 13k

short answer is no  there isnt a 35k rivian coming out next year for starters  you lost me at rivian saving vw  better looks carefully at  rivians numbers and how many cars they need to sell at 35k to make aprofit  they are losing money on everything they sell as is everyone in the us except tesla  biden administration just gave them a 6 billion dollar loan not sure how that plays out  not ever again it is three years from bankruptcy might be a good short  no one outside of the subaru outback infested northeast would think twice about looking at a rivian midatlantic folks dont want big cars flyover meat eaters dont want their big car to be an ev canada and vermont are not gonna make this a 100share company  not likely the market cap is already very high they need to start making some money  rivian is valued significantly higher for what they are than pretty much every car maker that isnt tesla  eventually people are going to have to realize that evs are still cars and the companies making them will eventually be valued like other car makers  no  that would put them around 100 billion market cap 3rd in the world behind tesla and toyota  thats a lofty goal but who knows  you are misinformed

vw doesnt need saving rivian does which is why rivian was forced to sell a huge chunk of their equity to vw for cash

rivian burns 152 billion per quarter 68b per year they have just 67b in cash

at this rate they will have to issue massively dilutive stock within 1 year to raise more cash to fund operations if you buy today expect to be diluted  now that trump
is in and elon is on his team no if anything id short it  rivn could make it to 100 and could also make it to 2 if it dips below 10 before eoy i plan on buying shares  definitely if they do revers split they just need to fill the form and submit to nasdaq for 101 revers split to make 100 for now  hahahahaha  only if the company survives the next four years  heres where i think were at with this stock if rivian can manage to stop losing money on their individual sales aka actually produce good earnings the stock will dramatically increase on the other hand the ev tax doesnt exclude rivian and they cant turn profitable soon enough to survive the stock poops itself down to 5  r2 comes out in 2026  i think you should stay away from rivian especially with the new team in the center and the threat of investigation  rivian saving vw lol its the entirely other way around  rivian is highly in debt and vw just gave them breathing room with 5bln  sure it will go to 100 if you go all in just like the intel genius that invested 700k in intel s

dont forget to say i just like the stock  rivian is a dogshit in this moment  not a fan but doesnt really have anything interesting from the company  i am interested in this stock it has massive potential but within the next 4 years not sure one thing for sure is that if trump imposes tariffs next year it will be a bad time to be holding rivian stock it also doesnt help that the incoming administration is against evs theres basically so many risks on the horizon that i would not touch it atm  how can you even invest in this company  lol rivian needs to learn to build a car for less than they sell it  i will be shocked if rivian doesnt go bankrupt every quarter they are posting over a billion in losses and they dont seem to be making a ton of headway rivian is not tesla 20  no  no  deleted  yes at ipo  yes  after a 100 to 1 reverse split when the stock falls to a dollar and they dilute the shit out of it to save the company  yeah i bet it could hit 10000share according to your indepth analysis i would throw the majority of my life savings in rivian i see so many of them on the roads  the auto industry is notoriously hard to break into for a reason

a product can look fancy but it takes a monumental amount of continued investments to sustain even tesla is barely profiting and not from selling cars but from selling carbon tax credits  nope  no bankruptcy soon  will feel better to be wrong but i highly doubt it as rivian lacks any clear roadmap for profitability and growth return on its assets return on its equity and gross margins are all worsening  seems like the winner here is going to be volkswagen  no  how many missed deadlines and dilutions to keep the lights on will it take for you to see this is going to zero  they were supposed to break even by q4 24 based on savings and model revamp bla bla bla is that going to happen  nope excuses delays and more losses  but dont worry the saudis will buy more shares to keep the dream alive  what happens when  they say nah its not worth the trouble to employ 1000 people  they look like incredible vehicles but at the rate they burn through cash plus the sluggish ev market i would expect rivian stock to go to zero before it goes to 100

tesla is a tech company rivian is just an auto manufacturer with none of edge that established manufactures have they lose money with every vehicle they sell for those of you that own one arent you afraid of them going bellow up  no tesla owner is turning in for a rivian  flip that around and look at nvidia i agree  hi genuine question it is 90 low all time is that still the case  but if its high like tesla its still not high enough im tired of these narratives  right depends on number of outstanding shares total market cap then compared to earningsshare ratio etc  i realized this with ford a long time ago  you didnt really address any of the catalysts in the op its not like they said low  undervalued so what you said is basically a platitude with no context

an affordable ev suv with industry backing and a relatively paltry market cap for the underlying relative to the competition is in its own right a very bullish vacuum to exist in

one good earnings call and its going to go up considerably 

try breaking down those facts compared to its current valuation and youll be contributing something to the discussion  cant lose if you dont sell  being delivered to canada  removed  remindme one year

gotta come back and thank you  deleted  they are doing that  hence why volks put 5 billy into them  well no they have to sell them other companies have been valued higher by just selling cars thoughi didnt see why they cant  i drive one best car ive ever owned  they look awesome  i personally dont like the look but ive heard that rivians are very well built and great cars  how about the lucid stock and ev cars   iowa mention lfg guess ill buy more  looks like a truck for chicks  also suvs are mainly for the north american market and north america is very much behind with charging infrastructure compared to china and europe outside north america people prefer smaller cars i have no doubt its a good product but its just a small market and it is going to be like that for a while if we dont see a big push for ev infrastructure from the government it just makes it difficult for rivian to get big enough to reach economics of scale what we are seeing with elon pushing for the removal of the ev credits is to close the door behind for other ev makers to become established  only a matter of time before he pisses trump off enough to get fired  hes pissed off his largest buying demographic and is making himself a lot of political enemies as well though  what i believe matters is what can be offered

what can elon offer a southern state

he has a car factory in texas and germany that is not at capacity it does not seem like it would make sense for tesla to open a second plant in the us south east coast although i guess this is a viable option both plants that tesla has that serves this area are under cap

his social media company is losing money and im unsure what expansion it could provide

his ai company has no product and seems to exist to interdeal with the car company

his boring company has not had the success needed to encourage widespread projects

his space company could expand to other southern states

then compare bezos

he can offer amazon distribution facilities amazon data centers anthropic data centers blue origin facilities etc on top of a rivian facility

i dont perceive that musk has the upper hand in any way he can sit next to the president full time but he doesnt have the offer to move the needle 

if anything the threat of musk has forced bezos into the posture where strategic decision making is a focus  this  for america or rivn  didnt they put rivian execs as ceo of vw na and the joint venture it seems like the rivian exec team is doing the shadow puppeteering unless im missing something  only if that ceo is a crooked psychopath and if the rule of law is taking a vacation  he should probably acquire them given that the cybertruck is junk  whos that  but whats going to happen if the incoming war against evs happens with trump and his best mate elon coming into power again 

havent they been talking about shutting down all the ev plants etc  they lose approximately 32k for every vehicle they sell  their next lineup of vehicles are going to be a lot cheaper to produce  the doe financing the next plant worries me banks love finincing things like this and they saw the books and passed its also equally likly to be pulled as funded  vw doesnt have the experience to designmake a good ev and to sell a good ev well  this is simply not true the current lineup of cars starts at like 97000 they absolutely make a profit on 100000 cars that i see all over california the problem is the initial capital costs for tooling procurement testing then manufacturing to start a legit car company are insane when musk took over tesla they already had  that manufacturing tooling testing and procurement already in place musk oversaw the much larger scaling of those factors to push out the model 3 which made tesla finally profitable

if rivian can put out the r3 and ramp production on it they will turn the corner its gonna be a few years but that car will sell well  all they need are headlights that dont look idiotic and the whole car would be sleek but alas anyways i wouldnt buy stock in a company that loses money on every vehicle they sell and dont have the demand needed to reach the break even point inventory levels are way too high even amid lower production for retooling  that isnt how it works      

 vw and all other legacy auto mfgs are sitting on 50 years of legacy debt and contractual agreements     

the return on these investments has already occurred         

the new entrants to the market do not have any of that debt or obligations        

instead they have the negative cash flow of establishing product and production systems these things provide a future return on investment        

to likeconceptually compare the market cap of vw to rivian and then suggesting that one would or would not be larger than the other is casually ignoring the 50 years of debt and obligations         it would be expected that if a new entrant were able to achieve scale and cash flow positive operations that their market cap would surpass legacy due to the absence of legacy transactions debt obligations    

 this applies to any capital intensive vertical and any new entrant automotive is the most applicable as it demands extreme capital in order to achieve a return   

to give some clarity vw is serving over 200b of debt rivian is at 5b if scale is achieved the math favors rivian over time they build up legacy debt and the cycle continues this cycle is why new entrants exist  except this analysis never works for ev startups ever its not about numbers at all  the only reason i know about rivian is hearing it in this news and seeing it at tysons corner mall in a showroom after walking by i told my wife what happens if you buy the car and the company goes under  agree small group of the population they are selling to if a vehicle manufacture could produce a basic truck for the willing person gas diesel or electric for around 30k new they would do great the problem with electric vehicles is their charge towing capacity anyone who tows daily or anything heavy they are just not going to use an electric vehicle   seems like a premium product limited to a premium audience

whats wrong with that  race is the best performing automaker stock  look up what their car is and what volume

there is money to be made in premium lowvolume speciality vehicles

i hope rivian recognizes that and finds their market with sustainable growth  people expecting them to match toyota sales volumes is not realistic or healthy  

i would like to see them partner with someone who can deliver better production volume basically overnight without the 5 years and billions of costs doing a factory

take some automaker thats flailing to have something popular or desirable and is just wasting their factory capacity  vw stellantis one of the many industrial builders who is floundering

let rivian take over a facility and some supply chain elements and let them apply some new thinking and approaches  rivian would see the big and sudden production increase that investors have been waiting for  the partner would get some life out of a wasting asset and could agree to share some of rivians features or concepts  r2 price is 45k  yeah but if they can take the car and keep it along with doing other things w the company there could be an upscale on profit tesla seems like a ticking time bomb although i do have 30 shades of tesla from when it was at 108  share  just to play devils advocate a little bit  the biggest selling cars in america are all trucks that are 55k100k depending on model and addons etc 

whilst i personally dont think evs will ever really
become as widespread as combustion engines i just cant see them being popular enough theyll be plenty of them in the big cities but noone in rural america will want these until there is a masssssive infrastructure investment and it seems like the new government will do the opposite  i dont think itd fly with reconciliation which would be the only way since they dont control the senate and they barely control the house so even if they remove the filibuster i feel like the house dems would go at this like rabid dogs  thats just imagination and grandstanding no sane person will base their decision on politics over the appeal of the car itelf for such a large purchase

its like saying those who hate trump saying they wouldnt want to live under his rule yet i dont see airports getting more full  the number of people who wont buy is balanced by the number of new people who will  

musk wont be around much longer i think he is off to spacex when his contract expires in 2028  debt  hopium  5 plus years to see good profit and 100 share if they do well  post up that model fellow rivn investor  heres my model discounting back from 2030 to today which shows that its trading a bit under what might be preset value if you do any sensitivity analysis you find that the present expected value is highly sensitive to any change in the likelihood of a strong bull outcome

ev b	122  this is hilariousrivian will be up to its eyeballs in debt by the time the ga factory is done not going to be profitable ever  i predict 5 years until they are making decent profit and minimum that or longer for 100 a share and i honestly like the look of the rivians versus tesla though im too poor for either  software defined vehicle is such a nonsensical buzzword if they dont even have a strong story around autonomous driving how can they claim to be a software defined vehicle im a shareholder myself but i find that phrase ridiculous also not everyone wants their car to be a piece of software that is subject to the whims of the company some people think a vehicle should be a durable or luxurious piece of equipment who wants to pay 80k for a piece of software anyhow people have come to expect software to be free or ad supported  do you know where i can track her i can not find her portfolio online  it would be interesting to see california taxpayers forced to subsidize manufacturing jobs in il ga  sc that would compete against the 22000 manufacturing jobs at tesla in ca  tariffs tariffs everywhere  lots of teslas core and richest customers have started switching to rivian plenty of demand  my thoughts are that we used to be a country where a scam artist like ramaswamy would have to worry about prison time while committing securities fraud in broad daylight  hes one timeline off from shkreli  cant disagree with things youre saying

but i like to imagine what if scaringe gets smart and acts like rivian is a startup that uses every dollar wisely and becomes obsessed with first profit  imagine if he takes this part shortage crisis and turns it into an opportunity building his own micro supply chain to not just guarantee supply but slash cost

imagine then if that is announced and at the next er they say this solution means they can get back to growth and forecast 100k units next year instead of 50k 

sure thats a bit of an optimistic sequence of events but its not really far fetched either  

its the kind of narrative that sends rivn back to 20  

next imagine he does a smart strategic partnership with someone who has surplus factory and supply chain capacity but moribund products and demands  rivian then leverages that for instant production ramp no need to spend billions and wait 5 years  they just start ramping on a sustainable scale now and let the mega factory build take whatever time it takes  

again its an ambitious idea but doesnt require any miracles just a bit of work  that cofactory could add 5 or 6 digit production volume numbers without breaking the bank

this two year strategic plan if executed could change everything  each move slashes the loss per vehicle metric dramatically which seems to be something superficial markets have latched onto  so europeans would be more inclined to buy rivians then  you mean like every start up ever   profits come with volume  its really that simple the trick is surviving until volumeprofit curves collide  literally what theyre in the process of doing with the r2  oh good not just me people came at me when i posted about rivians future and they are not making money plus more debt with new loan   it of the car companies per share its low its a company picking up and has foreseeable growth in not just one style of evs  say that lol  the saudis the post is about rivian not lucid you have no idea what youre talking about lmfao  lol  can go down another 90  theres a peter lynch saying about this what do you call a stock thats down 90 answer a stock that was down 80 and then saw its value get cut in half again

regardless of how much a stock is down when you buy it the most that you can lose is 100 of the money you put into it  i dont think you can count the all time high here it ran crazy at ipo during a time the market was crazier than it is now ive followed this company since way before ipo and im not sure where they should be trading at all you can do here is decide what your get out loss is before buying because so far none of it run ups have ever held just my opinion and i love their vehicles good luck  yes it is but that doesnt mean that the stock 
isnt at fair value or even over valued believe it or not it can actually go lower even if it is at an all time low at this moment  look at a goev alltime chart  thanks for educating me   its worth 11 billion dollars as a company and they lose around 50k usd for each car they sell  no theres such a thing as dilution look at market value not share price

op is basically asking if rivian will become 25 times as big as ford  look at the market cap or a number of other metrics share price is pretty arbitrary and tells you very little about a company rivian at ipo was absurdly overpriced blew up to even more absurdly overpriced and imo never really dropped to what i would call a fair market price that said im buying shares because im not sure it will ever actually drop to where id like to be buying it and i believe they will achieve profitability and scale over time  literally tesla has been painfully overvalued for years now  tesla also has the ear of the president and is a stand in for the influence and power of one individual  i simply addressed his rivian at 12 being low as a misguided way of viewing a stocks price if you want to take a look at their balance sheet and do your own dd to see if theyre sitting at a fair value or not is up to op decide  platitudes without context is the name of this sub lmaoooooo  i am very skeptical they are capable of making a 40k suv  yes they are being delivered in vancouver calgary toronto and montreal  i think mexico  and selling in a new market  thats why op has never seen one before  i didnt count them but looked looked like roughly 14 of the cars in the lot were rivian thats up from 0 a month ago  im not pumping anything just saying something i saw i think musk is going to use his first bro powers to fuck everyone but tesla

  thats true most voting americans are even dumber and more racist than most people predicted  and do you think just vws 5b is going to get them to 100share 

hence why i said some not just one  i live in bend oregon and the amount of rivians we have here convinced me to put 30k into its stock my buddy has one and its a gorgeous ride  any reason you picked rivian over a tesla  they do just dont check their reliability ratings  i love their look the boxy look is better than teslas teardop shape imo  lucid looks like a 1990s oldsmobile i have no idea who actually wants those cars

rivian at least has a very unique look  and support the saudis  fuck that  charging infrastructure nothing is easier than charging at home the us is far better situated for home charging   but do people prefer small cars outside of north america because of gas prices i know that is a primary driver here in germany i think there would be plenty of market for a really well built ev suv here in europe  its not hard to make smaller cars once you have the infrastructure also the r3 which is a smaller version is coming 2027

httpswwwcaranddrivercomrivianr3   north america is very much behind with charging infrastructure compared to china and europe

are you excluding tesla chargers  biggest understated risk for tsla stock right now imo  he also made his cars extremely popular with the right who are in power for the forseeable economic future then he is going to leave to launch rockets and appoint a nice middle of the road kinda guy to run it 

its a good situation politically if you ask me  youre forgetting that he has the advantages of being a drug addicted imposter and sociopath  surely that counts for something  doge father  no idea i would like to wait and see if that even becomes a slight possibility if i were about to buy im speaking from an already bought and holding perspective so its not as great of a risk for me as someone who is just getting in 

for me personally im caught in the net either way at this point just a matter if im getting put in the display fish tank or getting skinned and fried  this concept being the primary reason retail investors wont invest is actually why now is the perfect time to buy the stock if you believe in the companys long term success

if you believe they will succeed then youd rather buy the stock now than when theyre making money on every vehicle they sell dont buy the news  and ford lost billions on evs  that figure includes a lot of the startup and initial manufacturing costs 

they dont literally lose 32k making the car just factoring in all the stuff to get a car company producing vehicles they lose that per vehicle  then they spend a billion dollars a quarter to lose that 32k per vehicle just getting profitable on making and selling cars does not make them a profitable company they need to sell enough cars to pay their four billion a year cost to run the company  
  
the math is against them  the r2r3 wont save them as it will put them into a highly competitive market space  r2 is their modely competitor that needs to sell or you never see that cool r3  debt is factored into profits and despite the debt vw is still profitable 1b quarterly  just because irrational investors made money in the past doesnt mean theyre gonna do it again 

how can you argue against a solid objective analysis in favor of the once in a lifetime to the moon scenario that is tesla  its not about numbers at all

say what  the problem with a small vehicle is the small margins  rivian doesnt need to get into the econobox market just yet  a rivian basic suv priced in the ballpark with peers like toyotahyundaikiafordgm theyd have no problem moving 50000 units which would represent a 100 growth rate and would trigger other capital investment and momentum  removed  bro tesla is not just a car company 

why do you and others compare rivn to tsla

tesla has a massive breadth of products outside their cars 

rivian is not anywhere near tesla   sell those it will revert back to the mean musk will either get tired of doge when it involves real work and not just tweeting or trump will get tired of musk who seems to be now 247 near him good he is only a part time ceo tsla is always one earnings call away from a huge correction i hear no one in cali is buying teslas again any of those points could be the catalyst add seasonality or a potential recession the company has been performing mostly flat on an inflation adjusted revenue basis for many years now   dont think evs will ever really become as widespread as combustion engines

ever is a long time  i think the issue here is that people buying tesla the lefties of california are in fact not sane lol  2 years  they will be fcf positive and pay down their debt no different than what happened with tesla 

httpsmmacrotrendsnetstockschartstslateslalongtermdebt  lol do some research on it  the phrase has a very specific meaning  if that was really the plan they would never actually say its the plan 

this was a pr threat only it wont last 5 mins in the legislature or the courts  lots of conservitive who would have never considered an ev are shopping tesla now the question is which side actually changes behaviuor  you may know how many rivian sold up to now next year would be no better than this year sorry for the reality  that is a lot of imagination i think the biggest hurdle is the market for electric cars almost half the people who have bought electric vehicles in north america say their next car will be an ice vehicle and many of the people who have ice vehicles now arent overwhelmingly crazy about going electric add to that trump is going to remove the ev tax credit and it is becoming less an issue about production capacity and more about market desire 

there isnt going to be another player enter the market and be the next tesla because when tesla did it they had next to no competition that era is over and new players need to have something no else does which rivian does not or some gamechanging technology which rivian does not  people really do not understand the concept of fixed cost absorption saw all these same arguments in 2017 for tesla and kept buying rinse and repeat here  ummmm surego ahead and dump your money into them i see no way this could go badly  lol tesla was able to make and sell cars at a profit 10 years ago  yeah they been in the process for years  say more  and after that another 90  true lower can always go lower  yeah amazon isnt letting that happen my friend  i dont know why people post this and completely forget that it took tesla 12 years of producing cars to break even losing billions per year and selling cars at a staggering lossuntil it finally made it out

why would rivian not be afforded the same runway  so what most companies lose money to begin with the exact same argument was made with tesla for years in the early 2010s yet an amazing investment to buy during that period 

of course it cant go on like that forever but it can go on for a long time as long as they stay on track  and lots of growth companies start out in the red eg amazon and tesla and rivian is no exception does that mean itll eventually pull an amazon or tesla no of course not theres always a risk they dont make it but lack of profitability in the early stages of growth is far from abnormal  deleted  hey at least tesla makes money and rivian isnt even near that   dilution is more plausible than pumping to 100  you could say this about just about every member of the sp before they were the safe staple companies you all love so much amazon apple google all of them at one point were painfully overvalued for years  what you said was rudimentary and didnt address any other aspect of their thoughts

i already did what you mentioned and more its not really the point 

again youre saying nothing obviously thats for us to decide lol you still arent contributing anything

there is no risk in sharing an informed opinion you just dont have one  i feel like this tip is the blue collar insider trading tips we all need right now thank you   cool ehhh  i saw one in st johns a few weeks ago  i am a canadian ev owner here and havent seen a single rivian on the road the only two options i can find on their website here cost over 100k and neither are vehicles that i would want to drive maybe in the future when cheaper models come to the market but right now these vehicles are not affordable for the vast majority of canadians and there are already several equivalent luxury evs at similar or lower price points  i would consider rivians problem as not producing enough cars but if rivians problem is not even have enough demand in the us and has to reply nonus sales that could be a bigger problem to rivian  deleted  amazing cars but im not sure they have a plan to profitability  recently moved back to houston area to a suburb i see a crazy amount of evs all together but the rivians are thick out here  i wanted an actual roomy suv that looked and felt like a real suv and could do suv things it had be comfortable for road trips light offroading and camping but also a capable daily driver i also didnt really feel like supporting tesla because of musk

also very attractive lease deals on the 2024 quads at the time  care to elaborate  huh what lucid air look amazing rivian looks like a plastic toy the lights are so ugly compared to the slickness of the lucid  

and apparently they have a much longer distance capability of like 500 miles  ironically being low key and unnoticeable can be a very desirable quality for someone dropping 100k on a car  that market is pretty much tapped out many people rent or live in apartments youre not getting country folk to buy evs anytime soon 

and yea charging infrastructure matters are you confused  they are far more expensive going to cost more electricity bills and more difficult to maneuver in dense cities in denmark suvs only make up 23 of all cars on the street and pretty much been the same picture in pretty much all the european countries i have been to for the most part station cars are as big as they get in here in europe

also us suvs are much bigger than european suvs  but thats only one of the reasons most european cities also deter people from driving bigger vehicles narrower roads smaller parking spots smaller garages etc 
there would still be a market for them but definitely much smaller  he gets shit done and people love that

and people who work hard often play hard  thanks im a bit slow  why is it the perfect time to buy at 12 and not when it was 10 or 9

people seem to forget this stock was in the single digit not that long ago  so did tesla until they didnt  for sure  

it doesnt mean that vw is doomed or bad it could find ways to outperform   

it the legacy is the opportunity that makes it worthwhile to sink billions of dollars to try and compete  

 the legacy is spending some of the cash that is flowing on stuff that is perhaps slightly obsolete or not as fast or not as efficient or is interest   

a new entrant who gets over the massive hump has much more choice with cash

there is a window of opportunity that opens and closes as these debt loads are new and then grow  

 it is tied to the innovation in the space in a way    

 its also why a firm like vw would have interest in investing in a firm like rivian 

from vws perspective rivian is an opportunity to sort of rejuvenaterefresh the debt to a degree to stay present in innovative cash flows  same with gme and even google  the numbers for google are the best among the faang and it has the lowest pe  hes got a good feeling about it  you read that right its never about the numbers  just look at tesla or gme  i think it was just 11 months ago tesla had a big inventory glut and was having to give massive promotions to sell units  theyve been slashing margins ever since on a trajectory to get down to what their fellow car makers live with

at the same time public perception of the vehicle quality has gone from high to trash and the brand reputation has been tarnished by their crooked mascot  even he is finally sort of admitting his promise of a sub 30k car was a lie  they may want to play in the low dollar low margin space but thats not going to be as much fun  massive breadth of products  promises not products  many of which have 2028 promise dates from a source who has never made a deadline or kept a promise in his life  this is a hilarious take on tsla    been performing mostly flat

i guess my english is rusty didnt know flat meant up 1400  a vehicle where you can update the ecu over the air whoopee  i mean it doesnt take much for rivian to be modestly successful it takes a lot of sales for tesla to keep growing and justify its insane valuation  a lot of tesla purchased people bought due to it is cheap with ev credit that will be end next year this means whole ev market will be facing difficult time next year including rivian it would be continued next 4 years unfortunately  you realize that valuations are built on more than 1 or 2 years of sales right r2 changes everything in relation to sales the market is obviously limited on 100k large suvs   that is a lot of imagination

is it though  compared to building entire lines of beautiful high tech electric vehicles from scratch its not

if i sold cakes and was constrained by my frosting supplier id be figuring out how to make my own frosting by morning and in so doing id be making better and cheaper frosting and upping my profits removing a point of failure and setting up for better growth

considering the miles theyve already come this could be like an inch  of a step for rivian

 think the biggest hurdle is the market for electric cars almost half the people who have bought electric vehicles in north america say their next car will be an ice vehicle

this is the big myth  rivian doesnt need to sell 350 million vehicles to 350 million americans  the stock will explode if they can do 01 of that  

as such it doesnt matter if 50 of people hate evs and 50 of the ones who dont just hate rivian and 50 of the rest cant afford it etc  once youve winnowed them all away theres still people who will  someone out there buys candy corn and onions  nobody know why but they do

i personally dont understand why anyone buys goop or pepsi or air fryers  but i know that theres enough people who do that its completely meaningless what my personal preference or really anyones individual anecdotal tastes are  as long as theres 300 people who want to buy the 100 ferraris being produced youve got yourself a hot business  rivian just needs 51000 people who want to buy the 50000 cars they make rinse and repeat  

 add to that trump is going to remove the ev tax credit and it is becoming less an issue about production capacity and more about market desire

again the people who are going to care about that dont matter because they werent going to buy a rivian or theyre replaceable by people who will  someone dumping 80k on a depreciating item is not really a stickler for parsimony 

i see people spending a fortune on known lemons every day  i dont know why  then they buy the window etching  they buy emotionally not on penny pinching especially with higher dollar purchases

pop over to rivian sub  theres electricians who realized that swapping their 1500 gasoline truck cost per month for a 1200 rivian payment and a 100 charging bill still saves money and makes life nicer so why should they care about an ev credit going away

thats part of the beauty of being small  rivian doesnt have to be the affordable car for every human  they only need to find 50000 affluent customers this year which they have

 there isnt going to be another player enter the market and be the next tesla because when tesla did it they had next to no competition

i heard this about intel  and blackberry  and cisco  and enron  and gateway  and so on  

remember rivian doesnt need to replace tesla and coca cola they just need to find their customers at the right intersection of product and price  

 or some gamechanging technology which rivian does not

whats gamechanging about apples 17 version of a phone  or gamechanging about celsius soda or red bull soda or monster soda or pepsi soda  theyve all eaten fine while so has hundred year old coca cola  

its not winner take all  most of their profit in the early days came from selling carbon credits it still makes up a big chunk of their revenue  guess you dont understand tesla was around for 20 years  and arent old enough to remember all these same arguments of why they would fail  and they still almost went bankrupt multiple times  they didnt make most of their money from the actual vehicle sales govt programs  ramping up takes time lmao do you think factories get built overnight  rivian is at the same stage in business as tesla was when it released the model s  rivian won two awards last week for the r1  r3 

rivian technology is excellent when it comes to the software designed vehicle  so much that vw is now going to build porsche audi and vw off it  

it takes time and money to build the brand and production  i live near seattle and people that own the r1 are obsessed the amazon drivers love the vans the demand is there but the volume is low since they are a luxury vehicle if the r2 has the same attention to detail as the r1 at 45k  this stock will go parabolic 

it reminds me of when the iphone came out it had a cult like following  then it spread

they have 14 stores in total they plan to open another 50 this year  fractals are fun  not always cant go lower then 0  its already down 90 why it cant go down another 90  lucid is a prime example its backed by the saudi government  ultimately unless either company has desirable and affordable cars they will go bankrupt  plus vw has invested billions  this is survivor bias  because they havent proven that they can lower their costs to the point where they can make money

tesla was making way fewer cars while it figured out manufacturing model 3  rivian is ramping production and is losing money faster  they need to vertically integrate and otherwise reduce costs or raise prices  because elon is such a genius sarcasm  tesla came close to bankruptcy several times along the way they were one of the first meme stocks and made it because they were able to issue shares and have their share price increase at the same time  its way different doing it the second time the stakes were much higher when tesla was breaking ground lucid is chasing a leader down a proven path the rewards are less and the and that effects the investment theory  tesla is still incredibly over valued lol  removed  tesla was worth something like 250 million at ipo and they were making and selling cars rivian was valued at something like 80 billion at ipo and making nothing at the time  tesla by this point had decent margins you realize go look at their financial statements  read their sec filings and investor prospectus  tsla has a 9465 pe ratio and they dont even have fully functional self driving their cameras confuse the moon for yellow traffic lights 

go walk around sf and youll see all the self driving cars are waymo might was well buy google unless you really think tsla is going to do anything to ever justify that ridiculous pe ratio  it was simply food for thought on his last comment any dd he wants to do to make his case is completely up to him i am neither bullish or bearish on the company just pointing out the flaw in his thinking  well this might be good news but not necessarily

such blue collar insider channel checks are great when they tip you off to some little known surge in production and sales  

however in the case of rivian their production is very well known and its currently stalled  they went from 25000 vehicles produced per year to 57000 and then this year they forecast 57000 again  for various reasons like they were production and capital limited  but worse two quarters ago they had to dial that back to 50000 forecast because of a part shortage  then a couple weeks ago the reiterated that to 4750000 because the part shortage still isnt resolved

so whatever this person is seeing that production is already known and priced in

rivian formerly had big plans for a big factory which would provide for huge production growth but early this year they postponed that because they were way too cash starved to survive and build the new factory  

theyve since had serious capital injections and commitments from vw and a loan from congress to help revive the second factory build project  thats all very positive  

but if one is being a critical investor they have to realize that if vw gets into trouble or their own they would break their commitments to rivian contracts and rules and penalties be damned  they also have to realize factory builds are notoriously expensive and lengthy  

and yesterday theres reports that the corrupt ceo of a leading ev company is abusing his leverage with the next president to try and sabotage the number 2 pure ev competitor rivian  it might not be fair or legal but these are risks someone needs to consider

i trade in and out of rivian  ill buy it any day when it dips to 10 or below which is often enough  ive learned to take 20 or 30 gains when they happen since rivian often falls back on the same repetitive bad news

up to this year rivians ceo has been reliable and kept his promises  id like to see him manage growth without entering another cycle of devasting long term losses bogged down in a 10 year factory build or something

maybe that means using some existing vacated or contract factory to do sustainable boosts to production  worry about getting to 100000 production before worrying about 1 million  worry about improving margins  that kind of thing  act like a startup that has to use every dollar wisely  once that shows some results and theyve proven themselves a bit then maybe thats a better time for a big splash investment in a futuristic factory  

ideally i hope he figures out this part shortage  maybe use vw money to create a micro factory of their own for whatever these parts are so they can avoid this kind of fiasco and get those critical parts cheaper  id love to see a quarter in which they announce exactly this that we didnt just solve the part shortage we dramatically costimproved our supply chain and now that means we can double production for 2025  that kind of thing would put rivn to 20  sure but youre thinking of rivian in terms of whether its going to be a 40 million vehicle per year mass market  its not  theyre at about 50000 per year and kind of stalled at that level theyre essentially a boutique scale car maker

but thats not necessarily bad  the best performing automaker stock in the world is ferrari and you dont see a lot of those on your streets either  you dont need to sell millions of units you just need a nice profit on whatever smaller number you do sell

maybe it means focus their very productionlimited efforts on cranking out vans for amazon or on custom orders for rappers  whatever is most profitable would be best at this time frankly  yea probably i dont go to the states so i dont know much about the yard signs not really a thing we do in canada  of course they do but its all dependent on their next model the r2 which is supposed to come out in 2026 then the r3 the following year these are more mass market vehicles in a much more profitable segment

i dont think they see 100 for quite some time though making cars is just a really tough business and margins are thin i really hope the best for them but its gonna be a struggle for awhile  this they need more profits i dont see it at 100 a  share maybe in several years if they find ways to market and make money  consumer reports had them 3rd worst in their latest update i think your odds of having a mechanical issue were something like 45 versus like 12 with a toyotalexushondasubaru basically jeep tier issues  yes agreed about the size of suvs for the most part  i mean massive suvs fit in my parking garage  in germany it depends if you are living in a modern part of the city or in bumfuck countryside  except he doesnt get shit don  unless you mean juvenile tweets  that he does get done

nor does he work hard  hes that asshole that everyone has in their workplace who claims to be a workaholic but isnt the guy who whines about his 80 hour weeks but you know is spending 75 of them on facebook or sleeping one off in the break room 

even his play hard is more creepiness than play  hes off delivering semen to surrogates as part of his psychotic eugenics fixation  or hes sexually assaulting women and offering to buy them horses before being forced into more conventional payoffs  lately hes become like every maladjusted teenage boy in crippling thrall for podcast bros and crypto bros and influencer bros and political bros and bloodsport bros and every other kind of douchey bro possible

he missed his big 88 taxi event did not see that coming then shit the bed on the october late submission  taxis he promised for 2016 hes now saying are coming in 2028  his robots are actors in suits or joystick controlled hallofpresidents style junk now being shlled by renowned trash mongers the kardashians

call us when he finishes one project ever on time  call us when he keeps his promise to fight the meta ceo who is half his size  call us when he breaks even one of his numerous harmful addictions  i had no idea who it was either lol and im politics brained  deleted  agree i got badgered for pushing back on the rivian stock lovers they just took on more debt with a new govt loan have had low profits for many quarters what is their plan to make money i would buy in at 68 a share as they sit  pull teslas carbon credit profit out and recheck  you cant seriously bring up gme when actually investing as an example how many stocks are there and how many of them pulled a gme

the market can be irrational is not dd 

ps there is actually a reason why google is that low it might be lower than i personally agree with but do some research into some major events that have been talked about lately for them and you might find out why theyre on the cheaper end  thats because google has one sacred cash cow which is search which means they have a single point of failure from a business competition perspective despite having a moat their quality has degraded over time to the point that normal people get frustrated searching on google same reason their stock jumps whenever they show promising cloud results because it would be a great additional core line of business also ai is a risk for google right now because its going to be really costly to offer free ai backed search to users and also difficult to convert free search users into paying users  unfortunately for you youre misguided
 you think tesla went up because investors are stupid and bought into fsd or something and tesla stock is powered by unicorn farts

the truth is tesla has been gross margin positive on their cars since q1 2013 more than 11 years and in 2013 total tesla only delivered 22000 cars

rivian is producing more than twice as many cars annualy in 2024 as than tesla did in 2013 and their gross margins are abysmal

so keep making that comparison to tesla keep telling yourself numbers have nothing to do with it  removed  you seem to be poorly informed and focus only on the vehicle department of tesla 

are you aware that tesla purchased solarcity and offers an array of residential and commercial solarbattery solutions 

they also have a huge commercial robotics arm that offer solutions for manufacturing for both automotive and again battery technology 

you seem to be ignorant to the scale of tesla and the products they offer outside of their vehicles   that is like comparing a typewriter to a computer and saying on a typewriter that uses a screen whoopiee

vw paid 6 billion for an ecu that updates over the air how dumb of them right   profitable margins on a popular car is all it needs to be a success  the market will be the same for both companies in that regard but the loss of the incentives will reduce teslas earinings while it will destroys rivians entire plan  market is not favorable on rivian next year you will see how rivian goes down the hill next year  making cars at a profit and being profitable are two different thingsrivian hasnt even reached step one  hey if you wanna shill rivian stock it seems like the kind of dumpster fire that redditers love  you think its a good investment knock yourself outpersonally i dont believe that a car company can ramp up when it cant even sell its existing inventory  i appreciate the insight i wish i shared your optimism because i genuinely think the vehicles are great i really hope you turn out to be right we need serious competition for tesla

but i just cant see it at the moment with how quickly they are burning through cash im absolutely rooting for their success i just wont do it with my portfolio  least itll never go to zero in that case  down 90 percent x times  1xisnt a fractal  exactly look at the outstanding share count they are only going to dilute shareholders even more with the vw partnership  also tesla did it back when ev technology was far less mature

now that technology advanced it should be much easier to break even    for a sub that is so dead set on never buying anything that isnt fundamentally sound this entire comment was just nonsensical and untrue using terms like vertically integrate doesnt mean your comment has any substance and i own zero rivian and have never owned any rovian   vertically integrate what  this is abject nonsense teslas break even point came in 2019 and by that point they had produced nearly 1m cars since 2013 the year they broke even they had ramped up production to 350k cars the year prior 250k cars the year prior 100k next 75k next 56k

rivian are making the same amount of cars that tesla were when they were 5 years away from break even 

so if youre going to try to join in to a conversation about profit and sales figure at least know the subject matter rivian are actually ahead of where tesla was at the same point 

and prices dont matter in the way you think they do theyre not making poor quality but price accessible entry level evs like the m3 everyone ive ever met that owns a rivian 30 went from expensive cars like mb bwm tesla s or x etc and have no problem dropping 60 on a car people are dumping the higher end tesla in droves    you can also argue that people have gotten used to buying evs and want better cars without horrific quality control issues and not aligned with and ill out it politely toxic ceoowner 

if anything its easier for these condones because theyre not having to concise people to switch from ice to ev they just have to entice them with better products not a new category of product  that may be so in your opinion but exactly half the market thinks otherwise and thus we have the price we have today  people were saying that years ago and yet here we are  well no

 after the s they nearly killed themselves going even more upmarket making the x and then finally they went for the 3 

 in 2012 they lost 386m with 2650 cars sold for a loss of about 145000 per car  tesla lost money until 2013 and when their first quarterly profit was announced the stock popped very very nicely 

my point is if you bought tsla when they were losing money on every car you are very very happy today and you were even happy as early as 2013 so imo its a fallacy to use that argument today against rivian unless you think they wont ever make money but there were plenty of people even in 2012 that didnt think tesla would make it  commenters point still stands though  i would subscribe to your newsletter well said  deleted  so on par with american cars

not bad for the first generation of cars this company has ever made they are basically prototypes  oryou knowyou live in a city that hasnt been bombed to kingdom come in ww2

berlin is an outlier in europe not the norm

with love an italian from rome  agree many think its a great buy and will blast off in a year it could but very unlikely and thats gambling  i believe they are still profitable just not as profitable  look we cant just say that these are on off incidents carvana is another example of a company with shaky reputation yet it has climbed hundreds of percentage points from its recent low imo riviana numbers dont matter because there is always that chance a big player can partner with them i dont buy it on its stats but its potential  ill end with this the price of tsla is high even when accounting for that rivian started a bit later and is making up for capital costs for tooling tesla had a huge advantage from the tax credit and being the only ev mass produced for a while but the current pe is insane by numbers rivian might be priced right but its certainly pricing tesla very wrong  i did but i appreciate you transparently projecting that you didnt   you seem to be poorly informed and focus only on the vehicle department of tesla 
 are you aware that tesla purchased solarcity and offers an array of residential and commercial solarbattery solutions 
 they also have a huge commercial robotics arm that offer solutions for manufacturing for both automotive and again battery technology 
 you seem to be ignorant to the scale of tesla and the products they offer outside of their vehicles 

youre the one who seems to be poorly informed and ignorant    

you come by it honestly i assume as it seems to be a prerequisite for blind tesla worship  thanks nostradamus  there are stocks i like and stocks i dont i only like to be into a small amount of riskier stocks rivian is more volatile than amazon nvidua etc  rj in recent interview talked about how the existing supplier contractors were negotiated during covid at low volumes  they got bad prices they renegotiated those contracts and lowered costs by 2030 

they also renovated factory in june which increased line speed by 30  they laid off a lot of staff as well  

they were losing 140k per vehicle over year ago losing 30k in q2  they had noted q3 would be worst quarter of year early last year 

rj stated the vw investment gave them enough capital to launch r2 r3 and build the georgia factory  

rivian stated they will post gross positive profit in q4 of 2024 once that happens it will allow institutional money to get in  many funds cant buy companies not turning a profit once that happens buckle up  im reading this while eating pumpkin pi  except even well established car companies struggle with evs  tesla had customers the ev market has stagnated  the obvious comparison for rivian is tesla  tesla succeeded in lowering costs by building more and more of the sub components themselves  they famously pride themselves on building it themselves if they can  this means not needing to give some of the vehicle profit for the outsourced components to a third party  they are relentless with their engineering and reengineering to do things cheaper

 gigacastings instead of a lot of welding
 building their own electronics and controllers so they can consolidate them
 moving to 48v from 12v to massively reduce the amount of copper they need in their wiring assemblies
 building their own battery cells and assembling the battery packs themselves

 op listed some reasons in the for column for rivian  unfortunately none of them does anything to make them profitable  a 35k car is not what they should be looking at now  it will not make them any profit based in their current manufacturing methods  it will accelerate their cash burn

look at their income statement  their revenues are declining and they are still losing 1b each q

look at their balance sheet  their cash is declining and their liabilities are going up

so as an investor i ask myself the question  do i see a path forward for this company surviving  is the company showing me that they have a handle on how to make a profit  management needs to show me they can make a profit or at the very least describe their plan to do so

rivian only has so much time to do this  at some point customers will start to shy away from buying if they feel the company is not going to remain a going concern  look at fisker automotive

this is why the stock is basically at all time lows  i think their vehicles are awesome and i wish them all the best  and its a better quality product  model s was gross margin positive long before model 3 release but you keep regurgitating that copium  their net profit margin has gone down two quarters in a row  they need to turn that around

rivians comparison to expensive cars is irrelevant to the stock story  deleted  true but doesnt mean its not overvauled that market cap is gross asf  yea unfortunately people have very short memories like you said tesla was not profitable for a very long time

thats assumed to be the case for any large manufacturer  boom and there you have it i love it when people post actual facts  three killed in fiery tesla cybertruck crash in california officials say

httpswwwlatimescomcaliforniastory20241127threekilledinfieryteslacybertruckcrashincaliforniaofficialssay  tesla is gross profit margin positive 11 years ago and at the time there is basically no competition of ev and enough ev early adopters to buy tesla cars and now maybe rivian have to expect more teslahater to buy their car but in todays market the competition is more severe than 11 years ago and there arent so many ev early adopters who havent got ev and is willing to buy  gross margins in talking what are rivians negative what  that the company is profitable sure but for the pe ratio to be justified they would have to triple their sales over the next couple years which they will not do half the country would never buy a tesla at this point bc elon is a nazi trumper now and there are plenty of other ev options available  fair enough i have no stake in rivian i assume musk is going to fuck them over pretty hard  i suppose that is one way to look at it  yeah you cant drive shit in rome i dont know why anyone would wanna own a car in that city  my cousin lives in ingolstadt and only the new big homes have garages that can fit them  forgetting frankfurt   true but its appearing to be a very binary decision for investing in rivn if theyre even exist in any capacity by 2030 then they will be worth a lot more  than 12b mark cap

on the other hand they could be bankrupt by 2030

personally i think rivian is making a lot of very good decisions that wont necessarily pay off in the short term this year but are setting themselves up for the long term no other startup ev is poised for success like rivian  your probably correct  but for years the only profit was credits paid from other automakers  betting on meme stocks is gambling not investing yes you can win gambling thats why casinos exist i dont have an issue with that i know plenty of friends that do the same thing  but they dont consider it investing in terms of rivian they did partner with a big player so we can see how this plays out but as of now its not enough to drag them out of the mud finally the only potential youve mentioned so far is people masspumping it as a meme and another big player partnering with them for whatever reason those reasons are about as hard as possible to predict  tesla was priced very cheaply in 20182019 when it was unclear if they could reach profitability once profitability occurred the stock skyrocketed

in 20202021 the margins appeared insane and were for a while but production eventually caught up with demand and margins dropped and teslas valuation today prices in a good probability that fsd and other future revenue drivers will help tesla massively grow beyond a car maker

rivian is priced very cheaply because theyre so far away from profitability that the company basically has no value it feels like theyre building tesla roadsters  ie first gen products  but instead of stopping when they realized it was unprofitable theyre burning through billions and are trying to convince investors somehow theyll make it up with more volume  you will lose all your money in rivian mark this post  volatile implies it goes up and downsince the ipo its pretty much gone downlol  is that a fractal  lol what tesla had to convince people to buy evs get over range anxiety and trust if new technology and install chargers at great expense 

those barriers dont exist now for the other car companies people will openly consider an ev where they wouldnt before because the offerings were crap range has for better than tesla offer and now they have chargers at their homes and work places and public parking  what on earth are you talking about tesla lost an average of 145k per car until they broke even in 2019  rivian literally closed their main factory for an entire month to retool for larger capacity and new models  which means their production in their busiest quarter was halted for 13rd of it youd know this if you actually read the financials 

its funny that when tesla did this sort of thing and production was halted or the german factories that were cash furnaces for over a year dont get talked about in the same way by tesla fans i didnt hear you screaming about them needing to turn it around from 2013 while they burned through 12bn and got the most generous subsidies any car company ever got  it was hype and to the moon etc rivian are poised to steal the entire top end of the car market but also people who are getting an ev and cant sanction musks buffoonery  deleted  id buy in with a consistent up trend if i had money to sit id go in now otherwise id rather use the capital to buy in on better options  you are correct mark my words elon will ensure those credits dont disappear but incentives for other electric vehicles will  i remember that youre right about that but they were intentionally controlling their rate of expenditure also so that they would be profitable  if theyd had more credits theyd have done more rd and expansion if fewer less 

they were just successfully navigating the environment they were in  a fractal fact  what they did was incredible but they also had no competition while they did it great benefit of being first to market including massive government subsidies tax credits and credits now everyones in it so no i dont give rivian the same leeway  rivian going bk  teslas model s became gross margin positive in q1 2013 this was a significant milestone for tesla as it marked the companys ability to generate positive gross margins from its flagship electric vehicle

in their q1 2013 earnings report tesla announced a gross margin of 17 for the model s and this continued to improve in subsequent quarters achieving gross margin positivity was largely attributed to improved manufacturing efficiencies and higher production volumes  you really want to hate on tesla but honestly it has nothing to do with rivians ability to survive their future or not other than they will be able to take advantage of nacs which is a huge win for rivian and the other oems

for your information i was not invested in tesla until the model y came out  well after they were assured they would survive and thrive

my feeling is you are more anti elon than pro rivian  whatever floats your boat i guess but i dont see any reason mix those two topics together  ah makes sense now  and california will add them back minus tesla   thats just burying your head in the sand california is about to do massive tax incentives for every ev manufacturer except tesla for the very reason that its only eligible for the first 200k cars they make and that tesla is already established

but furthermore youre now getting people moving away from ice cars and going ev without stopping at tesla first my neighbor just dumped their lexus suv for a lucid they then liked it so much they got another to replace their rav4 these are rookie who never owed an ev  worst possible take im simply saying hes toxic and his favorability  has never been lower thats just a fact and if you take that personally i cant help you i think tesla has runs its course it doesnt innovate any more the used market is a absolutely saturated with used teslas thats putting downwards pressure on pricing and the competition is now serious car makers that can actually produce better quality vehicles than tesla can 

i think your arguments have more to do with the fact your invested and invested late than actually looking at the market right now its 2025 and tesla isnt the only viable game in town anymore far from it theyre now dated aesthetically and their newest release has been an unmitigated disaster i cant actually think of a recent car launch that has gone worse than the cyber truck",0.7906,1.0,1

this is system that took decades to get to t1

we already have extended hours which are incredibly low liquidity and basically a wild west

near as i can tell extended hours trading mostly serves media interests so they can report on real time price reactions to after hours earnings or on fair value va future opening in the morning

major entities arent going to want to be held responsible for large volume trades made at oddball prices off hours  at best it will behave more like otc  how do i buy call options on an increase in stockbroker deaths from oding on the creatine  im actually curious how this would work for options  do they expire at 12 midnight on the day  a minute before whats the cutoff time  and would assigning be instant from that moment  no thanks  making impossible for individual investors to sleep at night 

youll have to move all your holdings to a total market etf at eod  christ i can barely keep up now i dont want to lose money while i sleep  i prefer normal trading hours thanks  horrible idea a world event would crash out a market with the current time system a knee jerk reaction can not take place  is there one with no paywall  great i need a faster way to buy high and sell low  deleted  i work graveyard shift frustratingly setting up trades for the next day a staying up to make sure they go through   this is going to improve my gains immensely   i think its great  not everyone is 95 or in the same time zones  why market close in holidays and weekends at all should open 247  id be ok with extending trading a few more hours for people on the west coast but 23 hours is just a bad idea

i like being able to check how my portfolio did for the day a few minutes after the market closes and i sometimes record my portfolios net worth at the close of the market on a specific date like the end of the month how am i supposed to do that if the market basically never closes and im asleep for the 1 hour it is closed  casinos open 247  why not the stock market  fomo i cant wait another 12 hrs before the market opens  surely this wont be a bad idea for countless retail traders s  why  i dont wanna work more

and somehow this sounds like work  so i dont get to sleep  the cost of coke will go through the roof calls on columbia  coffee stocks rocket emoji rocket emoji rocket emoji

i tried with real emojis but post got removed  do it  i want to day trade while living in asia  in my opinion they should just extend the hours to maybe close at 6 or 7 pm est and have the market open on saturdays i feel like thats a good compromise  why should crypto have all the fun  ill never be able to sleep  now is will open up more investor from different time zone to invest in american stocks market it is very good news  calls on virt  ill have no downtime to read these reddit gold then  isnt the nyse looking at 247 anyway  can we trade options  can someone please explain to me how this is different from hoods 245 trading  maybe extend the regular market time out couple hours  as quarterly releases are reported on stage the poor ceo must be gasping for his breath nooo makes a speech and walks off the stage a poorer man  robinhood does 24 hour a day so why am i cheering for some random platform doing 23 hours  who cares unless the most liquid hours start to shift this means nothing  i think we should go the opposite way and only have the market open for 1 hour each day mondayfriday with no after hours trading at all everyone yolos in that one hour then takes the rest of the day off  as one of the people taking these orders i hate the idea  of course i started when it was t3 and stocks traded in eighths so i hate all of the newfangled stuff   whats the difference between this and current overnight market  will my stop losses trigger 23hrd a day now or my trailing stop losses  might as well make it 24 hour  they need time to reset their shorts duh  when will they release the earnings results  all in one hour including the earnings call   might as well go the full 247 like crypto stop being pussy  wouldnt this promote more jobs in the finance industries how else are people to pull a 23 hr shift  as a foreign investor living in a timezone where traditional us trading hours are while im usually sleeping this could be useful for me i usually have to set limit orders and hope they fill overnight when the market opens  also options    this is a terrible idea  and why not on weekends  well its about 30 years too late but better late than never  lmfao  party people in the house tonight  thats a big no thanks from me i value my time and sanity  cool the general market can make more money off the gamblers  i dont know but on my trading212 app  i can already trade like 2424  its only an after hours extension  this needs to happen so much bs and market manipulation happening outside of market hours it absolutely murders retail

pretty sure majority of stock market movement takes place after hours  i like the idea might create more volatility but highest trading volumes will still be during business hours  right now overnight trading is limited i dont want 23hrs on one platform it needs to be on all fuck i dont sleep anyway and nights are boring  i hope it goes through i honestly love stock trading so much i would stay up over  15 hours to trade  might be maintenance windows for the infrastructure  the algos need a rest  a lot of transfers and transactions are batched up for settlement  it must be for platform maintenance and for clearing houses dtcc bloged about it today on my bloomberg chat  the article stated for system maintenance  an hour for system maintenance and upgrades  that last hour is for hookers and blow  i imagine to allow for settling of accounts since the trades tend to happen with net settlement  time out for founder mode  probably to give time for contracts to settle during high volitilty  probably bureaucratic reasons  now i can lose money while i sleep  i trade lots but ya please no it simply is not necessary and more so when financials come out the small guy will not have the time to be able to act on it instantly the big traders will have someone paid to look at it that second and start trading  for those trading in 1999 this was one of the signs that the end was nighfor that cycle  how is this different to what we have today we already have overnight markets in many stocks that trade 24 hours

this is just another provider coming in to compete with blue ocean ats who provide most overnight markets now  all this would do is create increased volatility at least the benefit is i would be able to buy stocks on the weekend 

doubt theyre going to allow options trading 247 though  agreed and please stop after hours trading it creates an uneven playing field  yes  arent they just trading with other computers for a zero sum game  if it is so easy just write or implement your own  quarterly results and  8k fileings will be interesting quarterly results are how i make all my trading pl  i started trading with t2 the settlement wait time was a pain in the rear i cant imagine t3 thank goodness for t1   major entities arent going to want to be held responsible for large volume trades made at oddball prices off hours at best it will behave more like otc

i suppose there could be some implications for nbbo with this change  you can trade spx options and futures to hedge real time overnight news  exponential growth

stick some cash in these companies  this is my complaint about the idea options should be tradeable at the same time  traders investors will sleep well regardless  you probably mean traders investors care very little  ai doesnt need too sleep all the coke in the world isnt going to let finance bros keep up  prices already move at night right now its why stocks gap up or down at the open this is just giving you more opportunities instead of waking up the next morning and seeing your stock down 10 and you couldnt do anything about it you could now act on it before it becomes that bad  seems like a lot of you folks forget that theres a significant number of people that invest in the us stock market that are outside the us that already have to go to sleep during trading hours 

its not a big deal and works fine for them i dont see why it cant work for americans too people are being way overdramatic in this sub  it would crash and recover while you sleep so youd miss on the recovery pump too  this is such a kneejerk and oldfashioned reaction imo markets will evolve accordingly  thats why we have circuit breakers 

and liquidity is poor anyways in the extended trading hours that are available rn  yeah nuclear war starts  good thing we cant sell until 930am tomorrow thatll change everything for sure 


if things get overblown overnight great buy it and itll rebound or just wait

if you dont check the prices literally nothing changes for you  have you ever heard of index futures that literally happens right now  not dodgy promise httpswwwibtimescouksecapprovesamericasfirst23hourstockexchangebackedstevecohen2025launch1729089  doesnt the current system suck though for people not on eastern standard time  exactly i get off work 2 and a half hours before the market opens and some days ive gotta stay up just to make a single trade i want sleep dammit  as someone not from the us i dont mind this as well  100 on the other side of the world so market hours are in the middle of the night for this would be a huge improvement  exactly people in here really want to have less trading hours rather than more like guys if you really want fewer hours why not go down to just 1 hour per day 

it makes no sense that is just being a luddite  who will maintain the system it needs regular maintenance and these updates will be rolled out on the weekends  i think i would fair better in the casino let it all ride on red 5050 same odds  i guess thats the point of it all people like to gamble and most retail traders suck and if the casino never closes the big money can take the little guys money allll day long  agree almost every time i get a minute from work to buy something the markets either not open yet or already closed would be happy to make trades in the evening after work  i know im bad enough now quarterly announcements will be interesting im not sure if this good or bad it will mess with a lot of trading strategies within the larger groups  yeah ill be ok on 1hr sleep a day   youll have 1hr a day spend it wisely  ig lets you trade on about 100 all season stocks  the first part will open in the second half of 2025 with the exchange operating from 4 am eastern to 7 pm on weekdays once regulatory checks and balances are met the second stage will see trading operate 23 hours each weekday with a onehour pause to update software  i think probably more just for paperwork so they can record official daily start and close prices 

once they figure out how to update the ledger for continuous market hours they can make the next step to being open 245 and then 247  big money needs lunch too  legitimately made so that hedge firms can have a night crew and screw retail while they sleep if this isnt anymore obvious and should be illegal then it isnt any better than the southpark skit annnnnnnndddd its gone  already can do that try crypto nothing like waking up 10k poorer   technology that happens now  if something happened in the markets rich people wouldve already cashed out doesnt really matter you already lose money when you sleep its just that the reality doesnt hit you  im pretty sure you do that already you just dont get real time updates  doesnt this happen with aftermarketpremarket trades when earnings are reported anyway  they better allow 247 options  but how would buying in other countries work would restrict movement for other places and really put limits on how other countries operate when it comes to the us market  legend  no recovery if its trading 247 the world doesnt sleep on your schedule  deleted  except this will fix the liquidity problem other brokers will be forced to follow suit people will trade  in that event your money isnt worth crap hope you stock piled on canned and dry beans but a fake news about an attack would receive a knee jerk reaction later to be corrected but in the mean time a mass sale can tank the market  ty  yes but 24 hour trading doesnt solve the issue lol time zones are an inescapable fact of life all major trading firmsdesks are in cstest for this reason no professional trader on the west coast wants to wake up at like 5 am not to mention latency sending orders in

rant the current us system already sucks the players who can take advantage of a 24 hour exchange are large institutions with trading desks around the globe and market makers who can tweak algos for less liquidityrules outside normal trading hours

as a trader retail or professional you want less trading hours in the day to maximize volatility in a shorter timeframe hong kong does it best with no after hours a one hour lunch break for their traders so everything except for two etfs are halted and then a 3 hour trading session afterhours

no one wants to wake up at like 3 am in any timezone to trade some surprise news headline and theyre not getting good prints doing so no one but institutions with european and asian desks can reasonably take advantage of those this obliterates wlb for those that are actual fulltime traders  let me keep my advantage thank you very much  you cant place orders that will execute on market open   let me tell you about this revolutionary idea called a shift system  who maintains your banking system that you can pay bill  withdraw money they dont need regular maintenance  2026 it will be 3711  well while i can see how this could possibly be a disadvantage for independent swing traders in theory i dont think it should make a difference for people who are engaged in longterm investing would be my first thought  i wonder how this would affect pattern day trading rules  its better than getting your stop loss gapped  not really aftermarket trades are more or less like you and me making an agreement afterhours at some set price and then we publish the price we agreed upon it does not represent true markets or trade 

when the markets open it will immediately move to a position that the market as a whole agrees on what a few trades after hours has no real bearing on anything nor the volume  make them conform to the us market timing then i mean most people overseas do stay up late to trade in the us market anyway the intramarket period is the best time to trade after all  american moment  why shouldnt there be a recovery only down from now on  i hard disagree with your take you really think fewer market hours is better than more and you think hong kong is the market to emulate no  you can already trade 19 hours a day  a mass sale tanking the market temporarily only to a point where the fail safe auto closes the market  sounds like a great buying opportunity 

and then once it auto shuts people realize armageddon didnt actually happen prices return to normal



almost like  if you didnt  check prices nothing changes 

how is the futures market open nearly 247 and the sky hasnt fallen yet  yeah this will just give algorithmic trading even more control of the market  for stocks yes but i trade a lot of options   they do need regular maintenance our apps runs on the vast data platform which allows us to maintain the back end without outage  yes that will be the new official workday per the doge  2027 it will be 711  exactly rbogleheads will be like meh just another day  isnt this actually advantageous for options traders given that options can only be traded during market hours  it would hurt the us market in my opinion traders in japan for example would need to stay up till 2am to trade us equities

i dont think a 247 open market would be a good idea but having an after market as such is probably the best medium  deleted  robinhood is just trading derivatives no real stock is purchased  not on fidelity  not really ymmv depending on your broker youre not actually trading you just locking in a price theyre the ones trading and they may or may not decide to fulfill your price the next business day  or a computer sell off from being hacked to continue to tank the market the prices of futures contracts are determined by fair value calculations which ensure that the market reflects the expected future value of the underlying asset this limits swings in prices stocks do not  i think so i keep profit stops and stop losses on and if they can hit at night thats just better for me i hate seeing back and forth in after hours and then the market opens and i could have won overnight but now we are back to the prior days price i expect this will be great  yes to the fact that you dont have to worry about getting wrecked during after market hours  so what traders in hawaii need to wake up at 430 am to start a full trading day screw japanese or any other investors if they arent interested in dealing with omg time zones besides limit trades exist  my take is just the opposite of your take freer markets are better more hours are freer i want to be able to trade 247 this idea you have that retail traders are going to be run over by institutions and should play in controlled kiddie hours is weak shit  i had no idea about that i use ibkr and i cant find anything about it being derivatives  again would trip the system stops 

and again an overnight event where futures are open but stocks are not futures can and do react to news and is often used as leading indicator of what value the underlying asset should have in the future 

there is no arbitrator of value that decides how much the futures market can rise or fall in response to particular after hours earnings sessions or a fed announcement 

ie the market dictates the price

however sky has yet to fall  actively discouraging people and making it more difficult for them to use a service does not tend to be effective when trying to incentivise or encourage more customers  the us market is a global market whether you like it or not this seems to make you mad for some reason  deleted  so lets say some market manipulator writes on his social media the sky is falling folks start dumping then ai or computer set sell level starts dumping this leads to liquidation how wait brokerages dont have the funds they cant transfer funds to your account or bank and you have a bank run  what youre describing is an outdated system its really that simple  sure its called a panic sell and its been a thing long before computers and can and has happened during business hours as well

thats why they have automatic stops now if the market moves a certain amount in a certain time period they automatically close the market no matter what time or day  fair value calculation the prices of futures contracts are determined by fair value calculations which ensure that the market reflects the expected future value of the underlying asset this process helps maintain equilibrium and prevents extreme price movements

arbitrage market participants including arbitrageurs continuously monitor and adjust their positions to exploit price discrepancies between the futures market and the underlying assets spot market this process helps eliminate price inefficiencies and prevents violent price movements

risk management futures traders particularly institutional players employ robust risk management strategies including position sizing stoploss orders and diversification these measures help mitigate potential losses and prevent excessive leverage which can contribute to violent market movements

market liquidity the futures market is characterized by high liquidity with many participants and a wide range of contract sizes available this liquidity helps absorb and distribute market orders reducing the likelihood of violent price movements

regulatory oversight regulatory bodies such as the commodity futures trading commission cftc monitor and enforce market integrity ensuring that market participants adhere to risk management guidelines and do not engage in manipulative or disruptive trading practices

market psychology futures traders including retail investors are generally aware of the risks involved and tend to be cautious in their trading decisions this prudent approach helps prevent excessive speculation and reduces the likelihood of violent market movements

diversification the futures market is diversified across various asset classes including commodities indices and currencies this diversification helps reduce the impact of any single market or sector on the overall market preventing violent price movements

not the stock market  deleted  lol are you chat gpt because you posted a bunch of definitions that are unrelated 

fair market value is just an arbitrary definition no one can accurately define what the fair market value of microsoft saying they did something like abandon all ai investment the futures market everybody as a whole decides that price by buying and selling  its a completely meaningless question are you just going to ad hom me what does fulltime mean when the market is not open fulltime having a wall street job that is outdated thinking

actually we should look at the crypto markets for inspiration im not a big crypto investor but having 247 trading is a huge feature

conversely if risk aversion is low economy is booming voters prefer business friendly candidates and simultaneously will have bid up equities reducing future expected returns

i find it amusing that just as we are about to have a republican president again the economy is booming sp 500nasdaq are frothy risk aversion is very low meme stocks getting bid up all pointing toward lower expected returns somehow the historical pattern will probably repeat the next 4 years

caveatthe first trump presidency broke this trend and sample sizes are low so unclear how robust this pattern is  also for what it is worth i attribute little to how much specific policies of a president actually impacts market returns this is more about how investors perceive administrations as well as coincidental timings of the business cycle which impact how people vote moreover this historical pattern goes back a century and both parties have seen enormous changes in policy stances so hard to make a broad point about who is actually better for markets  dont hate  appreciate  good morning everyone

anyone here still holding asts i believe in the company and i made profit earlier during summer but i relapsed and bought back before earningsso now i either wait and average down or just cut my losses and move on  its really scary when you think about the way that trading algos work with market makers you have people like trump announcing tariffs only for the next day they get the mexican president to say no no no trump will be nice  and the market just pumps higher and higher off of gimmicks like that when stocks stall they create an illusionary obstacle only to tell you the next day it doesnt exist this causes the algos to go crazy and have an orgasm bruh that obstacle never existed  undervalued recommendations to keep an eye on over the next year

half of my net worth currently in ionq i expect them to go up 50 this week theyre like applovin or rklb on steroids  if the bored apes start hyping its definitely time to sell  yeee haaaw  mid and small caps ripping  guys ionq keeps making me richer already up 4 in overnight market i was told investing isnt this easy you guys lied to me  so covered calls right  with trump tax cuts incoming next year

personal income tax will go down significantly along with no tax on tips and overtime for low income workers 

 corporate income tax will reduce to 15 from
22 for those companies with manufacturing in usa

this will be greatest driver for economic growth and release lot of capital to stir up our economy and provide good jobs again

stocks will go up significantly like they did in 2017 and 2019 and late 90s

make america great again all thanks to president trump  im trying to find the data but i believe that if you remove george w bush who took office at essentially the height of the dot com boom and left 2 months before the gfc bottom from the record the market performance is much more even between dems and reps bush was 40httpswwwcnncominteractive2019businessstockmarketbypresidentindexhtml over his term and the only recent president not to see a gain over their administration

going all the way back to 1927 adds in herbert hoover who watched a nearly 90 decline happen until the bottom in 1932 that really hurts the average his overall performance isnt quite as bad 82 still by far the worst in the sample i believe nixonhttpswwwmacrotrendsnet2481stockmarketperformancebypresidentgoogle_vignette is the only other president to have negative returns overall and much of that was right at the end of his term 

on the other hand clinton is the high achiever of the last century he saw over 200 even ahead of fdr despite 4 fewer years however big asterisk for leaving before the worst of the dot com crash  again not a political comment this election was interesting in the sense that the perception of the economy was bad and that issue had the highest weightage among voters however the stock market is booming and risk aversion as you said is low there is a dichotomy

i dont believe your statement that people voted republican because risk aversion is low to me it seems like the average american felt that their finances went worse this current term and wanted a drastic change  sample sizes are low

really isnt every sample size low in the grand scheme of things  this is like sell in october level of trading intelligence  love me  yup about 10 of port now which is the max ill buy up to

still have conviction longterm but i think some patience will be required i think a lot of asts holders have gotten some fomo in the past few weeks seeing other even obliquely related tickers surge while asts treads water  yup once you realize it its silly  the options market dictates direction and how fast  its almost like markets trend up over time   european wax center

from plano texas how european  im eyeing saic looks like they fell on the doge news but i dont expect them to be harshly affected when the time comes earnings is on december 5th  hyliion seems really interesting although seems as though theyre prerevenue but definitely a market that i see as a bull market over the next 10 years thanks for sharing  hopefully it prints  lol once the bull market is turned on it is hard to stop its like stopping a train moving at full speed buttcoin is already ripping this sunday night  not sure its going to give you that buying opportunity  everyone is making money on wsb guy made a post he just started options and already made 100k i never thought the market makers would let all of us win this easy but maybe thats why it keeps making higher highs crashes are supposed to be when everyone least expects it and right now it seems everyone wants to wait on the sidelines and are calling the top you are not going to get a crash like that  yah i would hold  im cautious  not to mention low vix  yeek  i want to buy more of everything i own  depends which ones you choose do whatever helps you sleep best at night and what you think will be most lucrative for me its being invested and continually trying to learn more and find where the value is in the market make a decision and try to learn from it whether you go long short or decide to abstain from the market try and learn from it and dont get fixated on what you think the market should do like some seem obsessed with all thats doing is refusing to accept you were wrong which means you cant learn from it

 following what others tell you on here wont teach you much other than people talk a lot of crap and sometimes theyre right and sometimes theyre wrong occasionally there is useful advice and people point out stocks or data you werent aware of most of what people predict is based on what they want to happen rather than much insight into what will happen  nope a guy on a suit on cnbc said that micro strategy should be a trillion dollar company within the next few years   bruh you gonna go bankrupt again  no real use of quantum computing just ask google or ibm ionq is going bankrupt no income at all net negative margins  i mean i cant judge investing in effectively prerevenue companies seeing as i do the same but damn bro do you have any hedges to protect from downside  unless its just a couple of grand because you just started investing its reckless to do that it will still take more than a decade to commercialize quantum computing and thus see real revenue

seeing as you are a frequent visitor of wsb i can only wish you the best i hope you know when to stop gambling  looks like this guy wasnt around three years ago  did you put 50 into ionq or did it grow   my thoughts even as a person whos hopeful about the future of qc are half your net worth in ionq sounds _extremely_ reckless

it boosted from below 10 to over 30 in a very short period on a lot of whats probably at _least_ in part a temporary hype phase

im not saying it couldnt keep flying and you couldnt keep crushing on paper but id personally be uncomfortable where youre at and will be happy ifwhen some of my shares get called away covered by dec 20 225 calls and _definitely_ if another tranche of shares covered by jan 50 calls ends up itm  its neither here nor there  is it too late   collars  cringe  and what taxes will pay for gran grans medicare health insurance  looking at both a 2003 and 2022 paper it seems the gap in returns is still robust to outliers statistically significant valid in smaller subsamples and also huge in value i actually think it is not just driven by a few freak outliers surprisingly the 2022 paper even shows the gap applies to international markets too

also it is not as simple as what did the sp return its the estimate of the risk premium over treasuries and these papers do a whole bunch of other technical modifications im probably ignoring for simplicity they add controls for a bunch of things ie they did a fancy regression

the references are in the description to ben felixs video which i cannot link  risk aversion measured by willingness to invest in risky assets not sentiment about inflation  prices go up you can have a voter base that is very unhappy that groceriescost of living is higher but also in the aggregate have investors inclined to dump money into financial assets  if youre talking like yield curve inversions or entire presidencies for sure if youre working with highly granular data like say across many thousands of financial assets and their values on a day by day or even hour by hour basis then sample sizes and dimensions in a statistical sense are pretty high problem is with financial data the amount of noiseconfoundingunderlying trend makes even high sample sizes not very useful 

for example if youre trying to assess the typical reaction of the stock market to the news release of a jobs report we have a pretty good sample size  no there are sample sizes that can produce statistically very meaningful results and small sample sizes where you cant realistically claim a trend is real and not due to chance and everything in between saying a sample is small or large is talking in the sense of potential statistical meaning and they can very much be too small and can also be large  this isnt trading advice just a weird historical pattern but the valuations do suggest it is worth being diversified outside of us large caps which does not mean go buy the russell 2k  in a boom or bust type of way  yeah these are companies with great fundamentals but the setup for a large move upwards is incomplete they just need 12 catalysts to ignite investor confidence  i bought it when it was 597 last friday it pumped hard over the resistance true bro hopefully it will bounce back a little after a long wild run  its crazy right now  my account is up almost 15 over the last month and im not doing anything very adventurous  what does microstrategy do  ibm  the company that has yearly quantum computing internship you think they will talk about quantum computing is useless

just go to any physics department in well funded university and i am willing to bet over 50 will have atleast one scientist working on quantum computing if not a whole group  i will consider it monday but i dont think even god himselfherself can stop the momentum of ionq look at that chart  i wasnt paying attention was quantum bullshit hyped 3 years ago too  for you it is for me its not i already have half of my net worth in it at 28 so i can afford to average up significantly more and still be ahead of the game  this was also the case during the latter half of the roaring 20s  i just meant in the silly philosophical sense of well if we wait 1000 years these sample sizes are tiny or if we wait however long into infinity what seems like a big sample size to us is really only relative to our lifetime and as investments pass on generations even what we feel are the large samples now could be meaningless to those later gens because of how small they are  considering the massive inflation in the past 45 years its no wonder adjust all those gains for inflation and it seems more reasonable the only suckers are the people that hoard cash and never invest they pay you some good returns  they borrow money to buy bitcoin  lie to investors  might do more than that but lying has been their main focus the past couple of quarters  useless as in there is currently no way to actually turn a profit for it so its just a money pit 

im not saying great things arent coming but they arent here yet  so because the chart is going straight up lately its not going to stop going straight up unfortunately not the way it generally works the chance of a huge pullback at this stage is big and getting bigger by the hour  someone uttered a similar phrase in regard to the titanic right before it sank to the bottom of the ocean  if youre already up over 100 are you thinking of cashing out your principal as a precaution glad the investment is working out for you  how to lose money in the stock market 101 averaging up on this kind of stock when you already have half your net worth in it come on take a step back  removed  all that got priced in and then some  to be fair the line that goes up tends to continue going up is now a legit factor used by tons of funds nowadays just done in a more systematicdiversified manner and using other financial assets too 



when i first read about trend following  managed future  general momentum strategies it sure sounded like some ta nonsense pushed by twitter furus but i see my favorite fundamental oriented hedge fund investors like cliff asness at aqr making trend following a core strategy

its the iq bell curve meme all over buy stocks that go up a lot  look at fundamentals  buy stocks that go up a lot

using it for a single prerevenue stock at 50 of your port yeah not so bright but i sure hope it works for that person  brother not even god can stop this stock thats how confident i am 50 end of year target at least  removed  i havent looked into it too deeply but i think i have noticed a trend where there are certain mid cap stocks that have gone up in a more or less steadily line for several years that seem to be favoured by hedge funds maybe thats partly because they see continued steady growth in those companies and partly because the trend itself is seen as reliable but the sort of crazy rally weve seen with ionq with a valuation mostly driven by hype and wild optimism rather than any real fundamentals and that has been pretty short lived so far im not sure we can have much confidence in the strength of that trend id be very surprised if hedge funds did either but maybe you know something i dont  removed  removed  removed  removed",0.765,0.9983,1
Thoughts on buying BRB.K this month instead of DCAing into S&P?,"does anyone have any thoughts on buying brbk this month as a one off instead of the usual dca into sp 500

i usually allocate the same amount of money to sp 500 every month and have done this for years however given much the stock market is up 27 ytd especially including the recent trump mania i think we are due a pull back

and the way buffet has been selling stocks recently so does he however would spending the same amount this month on berkshire hathaway stock instead of sp as a one off hedge against this risk 

wb has the highest stock pile hes ever had whilst still in the market albeit much smaller i was just thinking it as a way of further diversification  ill obviously keep all of my investments in the sp but as a one off for this month was thinking it could be wise to load up on bh stock so can receive the benefits of the business of interest from their cash holdings as well as their equity holdings 

do you guys think this is a reasonable thought process or just stick to the plan and keep dcaing into the sp this month

i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorstocks if you have any questions or concerns  just wanted to point something out if youre going base your thesis on percentage of annual return

brkbs average annual return not dividend adjusted for the past 15 years is 17

spys average annual return again not adjusted for dividends for the past 15 years is 15

brkb is up 36 ytd which is 211 its average annual return

spy is up 27 ytd which is 180 its average annual return

if this is what youre going to base things on  you think brkb would be safer than the sp if a pullback occurs

a lot of people may not be aware of this but 80 of the stocks on the us stock market brkb very much included move with the sp500 if the sp500 takes a shit brkb will take a shit too maybe less maybe more everything takes a shit when the market takes a shit some just more or less so than others

you can see how correlated brkb is with the market by looking at its beta  which currently according to finviz is 087 a beta of 1 would indicate the stock moves 11 with the overall market and most household names like brkb msft etc hover around 1  some small amount

if your goal is that you want to hedge against some sort of sp500 pullback brkb probably isnt the instrument to use to do it because its too correlated with the grander market price action

if you like brkb as an investment and youd like to temporarily pause your sp additions to put a little into brkb go for it its a great stock

just dont expect it to save your ass if the pullback that you fear happens  even buffett not touching brk at these prices  berkshire didnt buy back any of their stock for q3 indicating that they feel their stock is overvalued that should tell you everything you need to know   its overpriced right now  they didnt do buybacks for first time in a while  if i see another post about buying berkshire over weeks or months instead of years i am going to birk slap them  the biggest buying opportunity for brk is when he kicks the bucket  from a value viewpoint it makes perfect sense to me also from a growth standpoint the more you look into it the better brk seems right now from a historical hedge against a recession but also likely outperform anyway viewpoint  rsp is a better hedge look how it performed during covid vs voo  diversification into brkb is a positive move not because the spy has gained 27 ytd and you think it might pullback but because brkb has gained 36 ytd go for it i might also
ps imagine what all the cash buffet is holding can achieve if the market pulls back  what is brbk  if the pull back happens next week both will go down brk is a trillion market cap company with a beta nearing one if a recession happens due to black swan event that doesnt get government bailout due to high debt loads brk will buy up those assets he has buy prices for a lot of companies as long as its profitable with a side of enduring his high cash pile will help against short and liquidity contraction but buying today vs actual recession date vs buying an index today vs a later market correction timing is hard if you have billions of dollars of capital it might make sense i just drop my normal investment in every pay period but maybe increase my deployable cash reserves slowly upward  buffet is no longer running the company probably

if u look at their latest purchases they made huge mistake buy and only to sell it after few days one after another

nearly all their investments that were purchased in recent time are under water or was flipped less than 1yr

look at their tsm trade they bought and sold after few months missing all the huge gains same with ulta bought and sold only after few weeksmonths

what are they doing

same goes for oxy as well they bought oxy multiple times at the high and stopped buying when price dipped

theyve been making too many mistakes

imo whatever they are doing lately doesnt give any confidence that their competitive edge will be lasting

thats the exact beauty of index etf

index etf never loses its competitive edge because whatever old company that is falling out of its competition is replaced by new and better one

no single company can have competitive edge that last forever

im actually surprised brk stock price is hitting all time high seeing all the blunder moves they are making lately  brk is my cash position  when i dont feel like buying markets ill buy brk  because if markets crater brk will probably go up due to their cash position  if markets go up it will chug along  

i suspect at some point it goes straight up in a line then we must consider the state of the markets  im increasing my cash and small cap positions right now ive liquidated the qqq in my taxable brokerage

any voo im holding is a long term set and forget so im just leaving it but im not adding more other than 401k contributions  removed  only time will tell  but if youre looking for things less correlated to market returns my thoughts immediately turn to utilities healthcare and consumer staples  say waste management united health and wal mart  alternatively xlu xlp xlv i think for an etf of those sectors  it could work you could also buy international markets like vea which are still very cheap at the moment  just keep in mind that the cash pile is currently tired up in treasuries for a fixed term so its unlikely he wb will be able to pile into stocks if we do see a pull back  after reading this sub im of the opinion that i will go 5050 rsp and brkb on monday  warren is the face of the company and his days are numbered i dont think its extreme to compare him to elon at tesla when warren goes a lot of faith in the berkshire brand goes away i could see a 1015 drop on the news  hi i actually dont think this is a bad idea i am aligned with you that the market is overdue for a correction if youre interested in dividend paying value stock you could also consider this dividend aristocrat etf called nobl id also allocate to a bit of commodities as well  just no  no  brk has 400b in cash and is well positioned to take advantage of a market pullback also a lot of its business is insurance railroads etc which tend to be more resilient during bad times  while i agree with your math brk has always been viewed as a conservative value investment its a place people are likely to put money in a downturn because the companies owned by brk tend to be more resilient in a downturn plus brk has a good amount of cash sitting around so they are likely to grab a couple companies in a downturn    

obviously anything can happen but peoples perception of brk being a safe investment i believe makes it likely do go down much less if shit hits the fan which makes it a good hedge in a downturn   brk will typically pull back less during bear markets but not go up as much during bull markets past few years have been an exception but warren never gets hit as hard as the index when it crashes especially when tech leads the charge see 2022 and 2000 tech pullbacks got hit during 08 because financials got crushed  i agree with everything you have said however typically brk has been mostly stock and its internal companies right now it seems poised for a market downturn and i think the stock would do much better than the sp even if the investment arm is a smaller portion of the company

i think if there was a big market downturn brk would buy a few companies  can you or anyone suggest some good conservative options that have a lower beta i feel like were going to get a pullbackcorrection very soon but i dont really know what to do with that feeling yeah i get not timing the market but i still want to  this was the chain of reasoning that finally got me to dump my conservative mutual fund for a broad index etf best choice i ever made  that and buffet is near the end of the road its going to get hammered when he dies even if him leaving is meaningless  and what is that that if berkshire isnt buying berkshire stock no one else should either the difference is that for us its an investment for them its a way to reward shareholders  op has been posting the same exact question in like 7 different subreddits  as morbid as it may be this is honestly what i will be timing my buy around  brkb in dyslexia  nope it will crater in a market crash alsojust not as much   because if markets crater brk will probably go up due to their cash position

when the sp went down in 2022 brk followed right along side of it  i dont think its cash position will save you through a crash but im sure its better than being in growth stocks  what are some examples of cash and small cap stocks  priced in  thats what ive done this month orders filling on monday  hes 94 years old i dont see anyone buying thats concerned about his death maybe it drops 12 but i cant see it being that significant mungers death didnt affect the stock much and he was just as influental as buffett is   i could see a 1015 drop on the news

i could see it drop at first

and then i could see all that cash in the hands of someone who realizes technology is by far the greatest driver of wealth in the 21st century making berkshire a better company with a higher share price than it is today  during the 2020 flash crash they still got crushed unfortunately despite having large cash reserves  pep tobacco   his departure is baked in

personally i think once hes gone theyre going to change things up ie dividends on brkb and some other stuff warren would never do  they dont see the value in buying it so other people would probably find a better return investing in another sectortickerasset class they dont want to blindly buyback shares to reward shareholders if they know they can use their cash for better opportunities which would ultimately help their shareholders more in the long run  its possible but with that much cash a crash would allow them to steal companies  when the market crashed in 2008 apple had 50 cents of cash for every dollar of market value in a crash those kinds of fundamentals go out the window  berkshire was up 23 in 2022  im going to be opening a sizeable position with brkb as well i might just wait for a slightly better price point  brk isnt making investment decisions in the short window of a flash crash  i know this is the stock subreddit not investing but i was thinking of going with a consumer staples etf like vdc which includes pepsi coke walmart costco etc maybe it has the spirit of what youre suggesting without putting all my eggs in one basket  16x book that has a lot of cash

my guess is that he has lots of cash ready to buy back after he kicks the buffet and stock falls

i just dont get the valuation  brk isnt what it used to be

  
2020 and 2022 were excellent opportunities and they did nothing  yet they did nothing in 2020  i stand corrected  i just looked at their 5 year chart quickly and didnt dig in  im talking about their share price  the valuation is based on trust its a company with a great history people trust that  they were buying aapl at 145 in 2022  that dip was too quick least 2020  im talking a black swan like 20081929 where we dont bounce back in a few weeks  neither of those were brk buying opportunities theyre waiting for a black swan event not a normal market correction especially ones as minor yes those were minor as 2020 and 2022  maybe they will buy sirusxm lol",0.9474,0.9993,1
Fellow Canadians: What’s the Difference Between ZSP and VFV?,"ive been looking into canadian etfs and came across zsp bmo sp 500 index etf and vfv vanguard sp 500 index etf both track the sp 500 which is appealing to me because i want exposure to the us market but im trying to understand the differences between these two funds in more depth

on the surface they look very similar both are canadiandomiciled etfs that hold us equities and are traded on the tsx they both offer exposure to the same underlying index so their holdings should be nearly identical however i noticed a few potential areas where they might differ

mer management expense ratio zsp and vfv have slightly different mers does the lower mer really make a noticeable difference over the long term or is it more of a nice to have

tracking error are there any known differences in how closely these funds track the sp 500 are there any instances where one deviated more significantly than the other

liquidity and trading spreads for someone who might not be buying or selling huge quantities are there noticeable differences in the bidask spreads do they trade with similar liquidity or does one tend to have an advantage

currency hedging from what i understand neither of these funds is hedged to cad is there any other nuance to their handling of currency that i should be aware of

dividend treatment both distribute dividends but does one reinvest them differently or handle us withholding tax in a way that might make it more or less taxefficient

historical performance have you noticed any meaningful differences in performance between these two over the years even if minor what could explain the difference if the index they track is identical

lastly id love to hear what you personally use and why are there specific scenarios where zsp might be better than vfv or vice versa is it purely a matter of brand loyalty vanguard vs bmo or are there more practical considerations

im also curious about how either fits into a broader portfolio if youre holding one of these are you pairing it with other us exposure like qqq or do you lean heavily on canadian equities like vcn for balance

any insights opinions or anecdotes would be super helpful thanks in advance for helping me make sense of these two etfs",stanxv,2024-11-30 03:10:27,11,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h2wlob/fellow_canadians_whats_the_difference_between_zsp/,,"theyre basically the same position you are massively overthinking it  you can find the answer to most of these questions by looking at the vanguard and bmo websites 

the difference in mer is expressed as a percentage of the underlying value a lower mer will make a noticeable difference if is noticeably lower than its competitor

look at the bidask spreads on your brokers website or on stockwatchcomhttpstockwatchcom to see if the spreads are different hint they are  molsson eh",0.9937,-0.25,1
Ocean Exploration Stocks! The next big sector! ,"in my opinion ocean exploration stocks are heavily overlooked with only about 5 of the ocean explored there are so many unknowns and promising possibilities 

autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and underwater drones is an emerging technology that i have been keeping a close eye on this technology will make things like resource exploration climate change research scientific research technological advancements and marine conservation more feasible the are key factors that will drive growth in this sector the next 510 years 

currently there are a lot of ocean exploration companies that already have solid revenue streams from oil and gas industries and underwater infrastructure like pipelines and umbilicals i think these current revenue streams will continue to thrive and future revenue streams are right around the corner 

costs of exploration have been the biggest hurdle in this sector but as technology continues to advance costs have been quickly dwindling making more and more projects feasible 

companies that i have recently been researching are oii and tdy would love to hear everyones thoughts on these companies and am excited to hear about other companies you find promising in this sector 

side note i believe that there is a superintelligent species living in the ocean that we dont know about yet lets try to find them  ",DoU92,2024-11-30 23:22:59,0,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h3i51d/ocean_exploration_stocks_the_next_big_sector/,,"im a marine biologist theres no money in the conservation field the incoming administration doesnt acknowledge climate change as a real threat so i wouldnt expect any monetization from that 

that being said deep water poly metallic nodules exist and mining of these minerals is likely going to happen in the future right now there are exploratory licenses issued by the international seabed authority there hasnt been any commercialization of it for a few reasons the main reason is that the open ocean is the modern day wild west nobody owns the high seas and the working definition under the united nations law of the sea is that the resources of the high seas are considered common heritage of mankind and must be divided up equally basically no one nation can mine and benefit from high sea resources 

noaa is currently the leading ocean exploration organization there have been rumors that the incoming administration wants to disband noaa and privatize all of the functions that noaa currently does if that does happen which i really dont believe it will then the companies awarded those contracts will hugely benefit i dont know much about those two companies but its an interesting topic  i have shares of kraken robotics pngv and krknf canadian and american markets  i am quite bullish on them and their possibilities  they also make deep sea batteries that  can withstand greater pressure  at 233 cdn a share definitely easier to toss a little money at and see if they turn out to be a thing  

they recently underwent massive dilution to raise 51 million at 160 cdn a share so you know they wont go bankrupt any time soon  they will be expanding and their are rumours of big deals coming up but we will see  ive been following kraken robotics for the a couple years but only got in in the last year they have both sales and services with a lot of goverment contracts with tasks like underwater mapping they had a large jump in revenue and the stock has taken off but they seem to be looking for growth  oceangate was poised to blow up  why those two companies specifically  i love the prospect but cant find myself investing just yet politics will play a big part of this and education only has so much funding to do it 

keep us informed if you hear anything new  you will horribly underperform the market and possible lose a shit ton of money  there is no commercialization in the ocean besides collecting precious metals which is insanely costly to perform and even more costly to start up  as for the super intelligent species probably not and even if there is that wont mean it will generate revenue  we have bonobos chimps gorillas and other insanely intelligent species right here on land and they are not generating insane revenue for companies that i know of  a discover would be cool but wont mean anything on a balance sheet    
side note the oceans are in a death spiral and there really wont be much to explore with reefs any longer  the next big sector when in 2030 years  imo water and desalination sector is the next gold digger sector construction operation filtration and chemical companies will play a huge role in the next years to secure water supplies  difficult and corrosive environment  this is not going to work  thanks for this info very helpful  removed  im very interested in kraken too recently learned about it and saw its massive increase this year how much room for growth do you think they have ill probably hold a long time if i do jump in  been looking into them post originally got taken down for mentioning them though  for a company with such a low market cap it seems to be very well known ive seen it mentioned on reddit many times  totally imploded  they seem to be pretty well established mid cap companies that are currently capturing a lot of revenue they are also set up to excel in the future use cases i mentioned doesnt heard they are diversified in some other sectors  agreed space nuclear and quantum computing felt like a crazy prospect 5 years ago seems a lot less crazy now still seems like a big risk  oii has outperformed spy the past 5 years 

precious metals are not the only commercialization opportunity narrow minded thinking

the super intelligent species was kind of a joke but just a funny extra incentive glad a majority of your response focused on my stupid sidenote though  i personally wouldnt expect noaa to become completely privatized i think a lot of their funding devoted to climate research and resilience will be cut and not diverted elsewhere i think fema is a real possibility for privatization but i wouldnt even have a guess as to which companies would be given those contracts its way too early to tell at this point 

the only company ive heard of doing deep sea mining exploration is the metals company from canada itll likely be years before we see any large scale deep sea mining operations theres a lot of push back from environmental groups and uncertainty with international regulation so any investment into this sector would be highly speculative and risky  it depends what you believe will happen  the company is based in the canadian maritimes and just on the other side of the border anduril is opening a plant in 1025 for their three ton underwater auv  the plant is supposed to pump up 200 hulls and have a dive depth of up to 6000m  the kraken robotics subsea battery depth can operate at depths up to 6000m  if anduril starts placing huge battery orders than the stock could soar  if they have to continue to take smaller contracts it is hard to say what the runway is but at least they are profitable and shouldnt run out of money  hmm i wonder why that is  isnt that a bit worrying never heard of it but it looks interesting  oii is down 54 the last 10 years  you can cherry pick a date to make it sound like a good investment  dont get all butt hurt because someone doesnt like your investment idea also auvs are not new if you think those are an emerging technology you need to research a lot more about this field  good luck  true it is not a pre revenueprofit company running on hopes and dreams haha looks promising though thanks  market cap was too low  comparing it to its ath price is cherry picking data it is up 3194 since going public 

auv technology has drastically improved over the years and has gotten drastically less expensive 

humans are always looking for the next frontier i think now is a better time than ever to explore the 95 that has yet to be explored 

i appreciate your pushback but i disagree with your reasoning  youre welcome i hope it pans out for us both if you jump in  ahh makes sense  no shit thats why i gave it as an example to how you stated its up from its five year cherry picking specific times can make it look great or bad wow that is freaking hilarious thanks for the laugh for trying to call out cherry picking data when that is exactly what you initiated with if you believe go all in put 100000 in and see what happens please report back in 5 years",0.9668,0.9996,1
Technology and its effect on stock market average returns. Does the future hold higher average returns?,"i know i knowi know no one knows what the market will do other than it will go up down or sideways

but i feel like we live in a different world now than we did the past numerous decades everyone has access to investing right in the palm of their hands virtually anyone anywhere can invest in any market they wish from their phone historical returns are 7 percent inflation adjusted based on old technology processes access and education on finance it is no longer the days of old where tie wearing nyse brokers answer their rotary phones screaming about deals and brokering deals for end user it was a whole process and really you needed someone to strike the deals for you and in most cases suggest what funds to invest in since there was no internet to self educate or even research companies to invest in

nowadays with giants like fidelity vanguard and others offering index funds that take all of the thought and most of the choice and a lot of the risk out of the equation i dont need to ask a broker which sp500 fund to buy i dont need a broker to strike deals for me i dont even need to make a call or have a person do anything for me

i am not a crypto investor i am a naysayer in fact but i cannot deny the effect that crypto has had on investing it has done a lot to make investing mainstream if not even trendy there were always hedge funds and major investors but now regular consumers are taking part and making retail a much bigger player retail tripled almost instantly in 2020 and participation has remained high

almost all of the hurdles have been removed between the investor and the investment with technology there is little to understandlearn and is done anywhere any time for convenience not a fan of robinhood but apps like this have put the keys to investing directly into the end users hands

now that investing is automatically diversified exceptionally well returning index funds are in the palm of everyones hand consider that the us stock market is the economic powerhouse of the world anyone anywhere for the most part can invest in us stock market this is appealing to anyone in a lesser financial climate japan now that the wealth gluttons have their claws in every last corner of us government i dont see them doing anything but moves to further bolster financial and economic markets the us stock market is the harvesting field of the elite wealth gluttons

my personal thoughts though as i said i am aware no one can predict the stock market but it feels poised to redefine average returns and with the near future political climateif it doesnt get completely blown up unlikely i think future returns will far exceed 7 percent as long as the usa remains the economic powerhouse that it is",DawgCheck421,2024-11-29 22:05:52,23,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h2ppqn/technology_and_its_effect_on_stock_market_average/,,"im just going to put right here that its going to be unclear if the world has really changed involving stocks until we get past 2030 probably

the reason why returns are not that high is because there are numerous secular bear markets over the years that have below average returns the last one was 20002009 or maybe even up to 2013 depending on how you judge 

its just not going to be clear that those have gone by the way of the dodo for another number of years  aerotyne  your argument doesnt match the historical record

the role of financial institutions in controlling the volume and direction of money flow in the market only began in the late 1950s retail aka individual investors were the driving force behind the stock market prior to that yet valuation multiples along pe ps pfcf etc as well as market returns were not elevated during this previous period either  if gdp grows at 3 yoy can the sp500 maintain 13 yoy  retail investors still dont have that significant of an impact on stocks most money is moved through billion dollar fund algorithms not me or you trading on robinhood also retail investing is fine now when unemployment is down and the economy is somewhat okay in a recession i would expect more downward volatility as consumers are more easily manipulated  you could maybe argue that there would be higher highs but then there would also be lower lows  tech valuations have grown much faster than their earnings growth so no it is unlikely to return what it has returned historically


for example apple was trading at like 12x earnings a decade ago tech stocks went from being very cheap to very expensive  this is feelings post devoid of facts or statistics in other words a shit post  the present has higher valuations but lower returns particularly in us markets

the future will revert to historical returns its not different this time ai may get some killer app or it may be an unmonetizable producer of lowvalue slop with people paying a premium for services that guarantee theyre aifree  probably longer than 10 years to establish a new trend  where do you think the hedge funds that entered the market got their clientele from the existing at the time retail participants i get what you are saying that but that is kind of my point i dont feel that the historical record applies in the advent of new technology which has greatly increased participation and ease it isnt necessarily who is investing but rather that a lot more dollars are entering the market which drives up returns at no point in history has investing in the stock market been a complete diy hassle free experience that requires little to no knowledge and accessible from anyone anywhere in the world now ya can

i feel pre 2020 to current is a different investing world edit downvotes for having a discussion and learning experiences and viewpoints the reddit way  valuations mean nothing when people run imaginary currencies up to 100k a share   the future will revert to historical returns

since youre able to tell the future mind telling me the lottery numbers for next week  yeah people are blind to see that investing has changed its been on a hyper drive since post covid   i dont feel that the historical record applies in the advent of new technology which has greatly increased participation and ease

the history of economic development is nothing more than the continual introduction of new technological cycles this includes services that increase the ease of retail participation so why should we expect higherthanaverage returns indefinitely when your primary justification is something that has been occurring for literally hundreds of years innovations and permissive legal changes helped fuel the mississippi bubble the wyoming cattle boom the roaring 20s etc the latter two had intense speculative inflows from international investors as well

as i said the crux of why your thesis is based on assumptions youre relying on stereotypes of the stock market and vague optimism instead of actual data  

 it isnt necessarily who is investing but rather that a lot more dollars are entering the market which drives up returns

if the core of your operating thesis was true we would see a constant acceleration in cagr over the lifespan of the stock market pull up any chart and youll see this isnt the case note that the introduction of seminal new technologies like the personal computer have neither boosted productivity or gdp in the way enthusiasts originally envisioned either

over time stock market returns are mathematically bounded ease of participation doesnt exert meaningful longterm upside pressure

 at no point in history has investing in the stock market been a complete diy hassle free experience that requires little to no knowledge and accessible from anyone anywhere in the world

we can expect worse crashes as well if this holds true  no doubt my entire post is speculation and hopium as charged i pull no punches about that

never ever has the entire planet had direct access to any investment they want and the ability to research to the worlds end that is my entire point

you are clearly more educated in the history of the stock market than i and yes historical data is all we have to go on sometimes i will definitely be researching some of the events and timelines you mentioned fascinating stuff i am personally hoping for bigger returns moving forward so my not enough fun becomes enough to retire

remindme 20 years   never ever has the entire planet had direct access to any investment they want and the ability to research to the worlds end that is my entire point

remember they said the internet would usher in a transformative era of selfeducation and knowledge too the flip side is theres a lot of bad data and incentive to get retail invested regardless of market conditions 

 i will definitely be researching some of the events and timelines you mentioned fascinating stuff i am personally hoping for bigger returns moving forward so my not enough fun becomes enough to retire

over time the aggregate stock market will go up and theres always a bull market in some subsector but understanding which part of the market cycle youre in is essential to preserving hardwon principal",0.9464,0.9935,1
Reddit overtakes X in popularity of social media platforms in UK $RDDT,"httpswwwtheguardiancomtechnology2024nov28redditovertakesxinpopularityofsocialmediaplatformsinukhttpswwwtheguardiancomtechnology2024nov28redditovertakesxinpopularityofsocialmediaplatformsinuk

reddit the american online discussion platform has overtaken x to become the fifth most popular social media platform in the uk according to the communications watchdog

ofcom said reddit where users post on discussion threads within topicbased communities was visited by 229 million uk adults in may this year compared with 221 million on x

the figures make reddit the fastestgrowing large social media platform in the uk and represent a growth of 47 on the same period in 2023 the leap took reddit above linkedin and x into fifth place on the table of uk social media platforms which is now topped by youtube after it overtook facebookhttpswwwtheguardiancomtechnologyfacebook reaching more than 44 million adults

reddit renowned for its devoted user base who refer to one another as redditors appears to have been boosted by updates to googles search engine this year

farhad divecha the managing director of the ukbased digital marketing agency accuracast said googles latest algorithm update in the first half of 2024 gave reddit a big boost in organic search traffic i think that has probably contributed a lot

ofcom also speculated that the change may have been caused by alterations to how thirdparty apps accessed its contenthttpswwwtheguardiancomtechnology2023jun14redditmoderatorsvowtocontinueblackoutinapiaccessfeesrow forcing users of those apps to switch to the reddit site the watchdog also flagged publicity around reddits stock market flotation in march this year

the popularity of x also fell over the same period according to ofcom with its reach falling by 8 since may last year x has been criticised over content moderation standards since its takeover by elon musk in 2022httpswwwtheguardiancomtechnology2022oct28elonmusktwitterhatespeechconcernsstockexchangedeal but it has also faced competition since july 2023 from threads a rival to x launched by mark zuckerbergs metahttpswwwtheguardiancomtechnology2023jul06metalaunchestwitterrivalthreadsin100countries

the ofcom figures featured in the watchdogs annual report into the nations digital habits which revealed that four out of 10 uk adults say they have encountered misinformation or deepfakes with the majority of those cases occurring online

the misinformation survey based on a poll of more than 4000 uk adults also found that three in 10 adults believe there is a single group of people who control the world together with the same number believing there is significant evidence of electoral fraud in the uk

the regulator also found that onethird of uk adults are not confident in judging whether an image or a piece of audio or video has been created by artificial intelligence",caollero,2024-11-28 19:55:22,1057,166,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h1x2aj/reddit_overtakes_x_in_popularity_of_social_media/,,"enjoying reddit less the more popular it gets  im curious how they define popularity of any of these sites especially when it comes to determining whether to include bots  26b for the 6th most visited website seems low  the funniest thing about reddit is that people love to spend their time complaining on reddit about how reddit sucks they are kind of like star wars fans they hate everything that got released since the original trilogy but they nonetheless consume everything star wars related voraciously  

the protest thing over the api was so funny to me just stop going to reddit stop giving them engagement thats how you can hurt reddit the most not posting memes about fuck spez or whatever people just love this site they cant get off of it 

thats one of the reason im long this stock  what does the election fraud stuff at the end have to do with xs stock hello bot  good thing i bought a shitload of reddit stock yesterday  the election is over the paid bots are gone im not buying this they may have one more good earnings but its going downhill after the election season 

uk has its own issues which makes reddit relevant for them but overall reddit i dont expect reddit to do well this is reflected in a lot of media outlets that rely on a left leaning base and ratings massively dropped  the question is when do we start seeing marketing shops offerring reddit ads as services its still quite niche look up any local ad shop near you and see if they mention they offer reddit ads as a service my guess is you wont find anythey focus on google   meta etc  op reddit overtakes x in popularity

me oh damn thats huge

op in the uk

me oh never mind  people love an echo chamber  i dont even know how x is measured theyre such an overwhelming number of marketing accounts and bots with reddit those accounts are actively driven off  twitter fucking blows  i like reddit  im sure that reddit is taking over a fair share of social media in the future as specific forumsboards are kind of dead reddit is the place to go at this point of time fb groups arent a competition imo
ill put some play money on it lets see what happens  x is shit and gone worse under elon musk 
reddit  x   yeahhh i dont buy that for a second reddit used to be great but now its just a wasteland and an echo chamber by comparison  removed  i dont buy this article at all   this is institutions whobown redit wanting retail to jump in  

rrdit is nothing more than facebook 20  x is more like small texting vs rddt email chains

more content without so much personal weight

you know like less influencer type content  x got soft locked less then rumble but close  ngl im new here and already enjoying it  i enjoy reddit more than x so buying stocks with what you like seems a great investment  i didnt even know reddit was classified as social media until recently and now it makes a lot of sense to me why it sucks 

i miss my old forums like genmay  oh no  x is worthless so what does this mean  anyone can get to 1 with enough bots making trash ai posts all the time  if you bought at ipo reddit is going to make you a lot of money long term  twitter is shitola so that makes sense  until reddit reigns in their ban happy mods and opens up the safe space theyre severely limiting their growth potential imagine trying to grow a business where you ban any customers that dont agree with your political views thats a terrible business model the current system gives them complete discrimination too they dont even have to pretend you violated a rule  reddit seems like its becoming ground zero for the dead internet theory  x is a dump everything is elon and trump its kinda pathetic  so a social media company that is known for censoring wrong think is popular in a country where the government will arrest you for posting mees  g new  civil war  never buying this stock shit site which needs to die asap if we want society to progress  british people seem lesssympathetic to billionaire supervillains than americans

elon musk has only managed to ruin relonmusk rather than the whole site i found that id been banned before ever visiting the subreddit because i questioned teslas corporate governance on wallstreetbets musk fanboys patrol the whole of reddit looking for anyone who can threaten their cult  reddit is entirely dictated by its users x is dictated by its owner hes made himself the unblockable king user skewing its algorithms to spread his favorite disinformation

he even sneaks around as dogedesigner then agrees with his own sockpuppet account  reddit is as big as a shit show as x is  find the subreddits that work for you and leave the default subreddits  the site the stock or both the good thing about rddt is it means higher numbers for er the site itselfat least the subreddit only brings those who are interested in those subreddits i dont anticipate more engagement from most users as rstocks for example will not be flooded with a bunch of trolls and such  every popular subreddit is a propaganda echo chamber im only subscribed to subject specific subreddits which are toleratable  reddit is the only social media site i use will continue to use and can learn from which isnt entirely brain rot ppl love to bash but its the best for old forum style web interactions  you dont want more skibidi toilet with anxiety posts  im really looking forward to reddits replacement at this point its become too much of a divisive echo chamber

the entire system of social media downvotingupvotinglikes needs to be eliminated and replaced with some other ranking system that brings people together and ensures that good ideas have a chance to be seen and pushed forward by a broader public 

tough to succeed against cliquey platforms that target and exploit addictive behavior to capture markets  significant decline since ipo  its been going downhill since 2015 i hope the stock goes up though i have calls expiring next month lol  feels like the common opinion has been that reddit has gone down hill ever since i joined dont know if those are related  true sign of a gatekeeper  ofcom said reddit where users post on discussion threads within topicbased communities was visited by 229 million uk adults in may this year compared with 221 million on x

it would be hard to delineate any further but that only helps rddt regardless the market just wants numbers  they polled a bunch of adults in the uk  so likely just asked them a series of questions and compared to the previous year  by mdau  i think most of the gain is bots  visits dont mean profits

dotcom investors used to use nonsense metrics about the number of clicks different dotcom websites got in order to value them but clicks met nothing when the business model wasnt viable some websites are just way more profitable or easy to monetize than others  you think reddit will be the next fb ie trillion dollars no closer to pinterest or twitter which were both disappointing stocks  ding ding   the question was just part of a larger survey on misinformation  they polled a bunch of uk adults to gain information on how they perceived misinformation reddit being more popular was just one of the questions that the article asked in order to gain context about how people perceive misinformation  it makes sense in context  x is not a publicly traded company there is no stock  mistake the election is over and the uk is small ratings dropped massively for all left leaning media outlets  yikes buddy that is not a good move  removed  its over yet were all still here just because you dont see it doesnt mean its not prevalent the best thing about reddit is you can choose to scroll past it if you choose to engage in the content youre just helping rddts numbers i knew it was time to invest when my wife mentioned going to reddit to look up some things that interest her i sometimes use her as a good basis to whats popular lol

but to believe the election is the driving factor of reddits growth thats like saying the mcrib is the reason mcdonalds had a good quarter it may have helped a little but its only a small factor to the overall product also if people are coming to reddit for the first time due to the election then you have to assume it will create return users who previously did not exist thats how growth is created its hard to be a daily user of something and believe its failing at the same time or be convinced others are not adapting  your negative views on rddt and many of the sentiment here has given me more courage to buy even more rddt stocks and i own a lot  it reminds me of all the haters at ipo who were all epically and confidently wrong  position 13m at low 50s cost basis  im glad for those types of comments sentiment was too optimistic recently for the early stages  its just another echo chamber that gets easily manipulated by nonreal entities and bots

best value in reddit is smaller subs and being able to get answers to questions

but all social media at the moment is being overtaken by bots and dead internet is real

for me its useful for certain information like other platforms but all of them make me want to spend less and less time browsing them  yeah because x isnt an echochamber  uk is turning into totalitarianism right before our eyes and some people choose not to see it  ridiculous   that comical because on x only the free speech musk wants is allowed httpsamptheguardiancomusnews2024oct12xtwitterjdvanceleakedfile  im not sure what youre trying to say but that sounds awesome as a reddit stock holder  rddt is worth only 25 billion and meta is worth 14 trillion  if reddit is facebook 20 then the stock will go up 50x from here  yup there are a lot of really nichesecret subs that i really enjoy  yea but those subs are getting overrun by the masses now too  they key to enjoying this site these days is to primarily avoid the front page and broad subreddits like funny and pics the comments there are a cesspool

interestspecific subreddits like this are really great sources of useful information ive learned so much from rbogleheads rmicrogrowery and rpersonalfinance over the years  and the users act like robots and post the same things over and over that they have learned are safe and noncontroversial so that they get upvotes its a total waste of time  i miss the old forums  doomposts with insane political takes  outright hatred yeah who wouldnt want that  do you honestly believe any other platform would change the user engagement to be any less divisive its all the same people migrating to another social media space trying to make an argument whether its facebook reddit x or any other site the words will all be the same and the push of content will resemble it  ok but how is any of this new you are saying its become too divisive  and the upvotedownvote system needs to be deleted but that has always been the system whats different thats suddenly making it so divisive now 

honestly it sounds to me more like echo chamber has become a buzzword for people are saying things i dislike in this area so im calling everything in that area an echo chamber it kind of sounds like the same madeup definitions people were assigning to woke 

sure some things get unfairly downvoted at times but for the most part i enjoy the communication style of reddit over facebook instagram tiktok x and any others out there when you get in threads of over 1000 comments in it i think its a good idea that the most upvoted comments get bumped upward on the page 

have you ever been in a popular thread sorted by random or new its often just filled with nonsense comments that no one engages with a lot of people just give lazy shitty comments and im fine with a system that doesnt showcase the lazy comments at the top of the thread 

if reddit is such an echo chamber why are you here whats social media isnt an echo chamber using the flimsy definitions people use as echo chamber nowadays  been here for over 10 years most subs feel the exact same to me  what you dont think an unflattering picture of elon musk isnt worthy of being the highest upvoted post jk

i agree i stick to a few sub reddits for news or entertainment but overall this place is full of nothing but hateful echo chambers of far left leaning politics  deleted  long before that lol  long before that lol  you cant just poll 4000 uk adults to determine that 229 million uk adults visited the site in a single month so ops point about how they know they arent counting bots in that number still stands  will not be next facebook but definetely much much better than pins snap and twitter expecting a 100bn  marketcap in a few years  are you saying private companies dont have stock  it doesnt stop at the election you have the inauguration the next agenda from trump the dumb things he will say over time and everything else in the world an event happens there are immediately 100 posts and 100k comments about it thats the game  i just did a quick google search and the uk has 70m people  reddit engagement is way up after the election  now every headline ppl are 10x as angry and its not priced in yet

bullish on screeching lib tears  whatever you say hoss  its been public for 6 months lol

but yeah i guess reddit is over   when my wife mentioned going to reddit to look up

yeah this is interesting my mom mentioned reddit lol

there was a while where no one really talked about using reddit or admit to using it online it seems to be everywhere lately when people talk about their online activity  profits are what will grow the stock not how many people are visiting it

ops point that ad revenue will drop because of the election being over is definitely a real possibility a lot of businesses might see this though im not sure historically how much of a drop this may be

i think its also likely that some of the user growth numbers posted by reddit are bot accounts pushing misinformation about the election that will likely slow to of course from reddit the businesss perspective the thing that matters most for the bots is if advertisers will waste money advertising to bots who will never buy their products but this will also make their ads look a lot less effective if say half the users seeing said ads are bots who will obviously never buy said product  ive been using reddit for 10 years the amount of engagement upvotes and quality of engagement has been downward 

it really dropped off a cliff post election

used to be regular posts hitting over 100k upvotes daily in 2016  2018 its not even close now even for subs not related to politics the cryptocurrency sub even during the biggest bull run in history isnt even close to 2017  2021  buy when sentiment is low sell when sentiment is high  oh i had no hate at ipo it was a smart buy due to election season

you can bet trump will go after social media platforms that use bots and other fraudulent methods to boost their numbers and engage in political biased censorship 

elon knows a lot about what can change in social media regulations and im sure hes gonna push hard for it 

maybe that can help reddit but itll hurt it first  anything a bit controversial on reddit will get insta banned or downvoted how does that not promote echo chambers on x its clearly not that bad imo sorry  i really dont think it is but then again im not offended by people with differing opinions so i actually make an effort to follow people with different views as i think its a beneficial thing if you dont share that outlook then yes its not a surprise that you ended up in an echo chamber on x just as you have here  rpelicans  i was like wow ive never heard of microgrowery it must be a sub for small portfolios  seeing as they are bots its not all too surprising  exactly at least reddit has a structure where that is mitigated rather than amplified the community mostly polices itself or moves to new subreddits if they dont like whats happening if it changed to users having to be verified not anonymous and they got rid of the downvote button it would become exactly like facebook or x  yes because history has proven that the kind of media a society consumes and the way it consumes it changes the fabric of the society exposed to it

not sure why this is even remotely controversial weve been repeating the same stupid mistakes for thousands of years now   ok but how is any of this new you are saying its become too divisive and the upvotedownvote system needs to be deleted but that has always been the system whats different thats suddenly making it so divisive now

well first of all the system used to work differently  it displayed both upvote and downvote totals not just a sum this helped to dispel the illusion that a certain viewpoint was unanimous  seeing 1200 800 is different than seeing 400

secondly people honestly used the site differently 10 years ago they were a lot less liable to downvote simply because of a disagreement 

 when you get in threads of over 1000 comments in it i think its a good idea that the most upvoted comments get bumped upward on the page

why 

this literally means that in a thread about a topic where 60 of commenters think x and 40 think y youll basically only see x because y gets downvoted this is how echo chambers persist  it means youre always seeing the most popular take is that really how conversations should be

 whats social media isnt an echo chamber 


classic internet forums are much more akin to real life conversations because theyre chronological order twitter has the community notes feature where a viewpoint doesnt have to be 50 to get posted at the top it just has to be rated as helpful by enough people and since the platforms algorithm seeks engagement often controversial or disagreement takes are right under the original tweet reddit is definitely the most powerful echo chamber factory  reddit is biased extremely towards liberalism while that aligns with me more closely than a platform like truth social would you can clearly see that the ideas that succeed on reddit may not be the same as what succeeds out in the real world  look at the reactions to the us election here vs there

i didnt say i have a solution i just know that we have a problem that needs solving social media is a concept if misused just as dangerous as nuclear biological or chemical weapons of mass destruction humanity needs to get control of this soon 

edit the severe downvoting of this post is proof that what i say is true despite stating im part of the liberal group the idea that reddit may not be unbiased is too unpopular so its downvoted and hidden reddit as a whole is left leaning this is an objective reality  ive been here for 13 and strongly disagree the negativity here has skyrocketed and quality content in niche sub reddits is at an all time low

reddit is the new facebook people come here to ask questions to argue with each other  deleted  if this is true then you are part of the problem  for one reign in the ban happy mods make it so they have repercussions if they abuse their powers and even doing something as simple as requiring them to cite a rule you actually broke and you could even have a system where the bans are reviewed through crowd sourcing imagine trying to run a sandwich shop where you let your employees ban and berate anyone who didnt fully and outwardly agree with their political beliefs thats a terrible fucking business model  its been a ride  to be honest im not sure how they polled for this study but thats how polling works doesnt it  thats literally what polling is  this guy gets it   the culture is shifting dramatically we won the popular vote people are getting tired of the constant rage and drama 

turns out its more fun to be on the other side where actual hope exists even when democrats have control you all were still miserable sad really  do you think thats a lot compared to the us or the world population that uses reddit 

california has more than half of that  fwiw i came back to the site following the election to see what people were saying after not using the site for a month and im already losing interest unless theres another january 6 or something the inauguration and whatnot are not going to drive discussion like a presidential election  i dont see it politics sub look dead compared to preelection theres better bets to be made 

im up 50 on joby and its going to do well i expect 

im way up on mstr after buying in sept sold at 500 and got back in on tuesday before close  way up on oklo because i keep swinging that it keeps getting shorted down to 18 before pumping again which happened 3 times for me and sold at 25 its a nice trade to buy and sell  way up on bitcoin 

reddit post election at alltime highs is just dumb  hope you have an exit plan good luck  do you have numbers to back your claim or are you just basing it off your observation could it mean that those people pivoted to other subs youre just providing a view from your corner of reddit without the full oversight of the site unless you can provide overall user numbers and engagement youre just providing false knowledge  i bet he wont  you must have never been to rconspiracy or the like  lololol  what stupid mistakes has reddit repeated and how would you fix it    reddit may not be the same as what succeeds out in the real world  look at the reactions to the us election here vs there

im not under the delusion that what is said on reddit is magically the mindset of everyone on earth however im not going to let the tyranny of the stupid who are overly susceptible to misinformation be the arbiter of intelligence we have 130 million people reading below a 6th grade level people not knowing how the economy or government works they dont know what a tariff is or that biden wasnt even running on election day we are living in a tyranny of the stupid where intellectualism is frowned upon 

im not in the delusion that reddit is representative of the real world but lets not act like the real world is full of reasonable people  wants a replacement has no solution reminds me of certain kids on campus that just want a kumbaya moment 

just like in real life you get to choose which subreddit you go to akin to making a group of friends that think a certain way 

just like in real life you get to leave those friends should have be your choice and find another group  

reddit is absolutely the best place to find groups you match with  reality has a leftleaning bias too reddit is not behind the scenes lifting up or moving comments to the bottom its the people voting themselves not reddit conservatives work off of misinformation and fearmongering so people spouting their propaganda are often highly emotional and shrieking in threads with false information meanwhile liberals work off of unattainable utopia dreams and has too much infighting amongst themselves which is a flaw but it doesnt relish in misinformation in the same way conservative outlets do 

so you can say redditors mostly lean left because its the redditors upvoting that content not reddit itself 

but also like i said the filtering system works most of the time anyways if you ever look at a thread with hundreds or thousands of comments you can clearly see why people are downvoted its often cause they have poor writing skills poor argument skills and often include wrong information or just filled with nasty hateful rhetoric 

i am perfectly happy with this filtering system i upvote good quality comments and downvote lazy shitty comments 

only rarely very rarely do i genuinely feel shock seeing a comment be downvoted and think huh why is this being downvoted its a quality comment most often than not the shitty comments are the ones being downvoted 

i think thats a better system than say instagram x and tiktok in which every comment gets equal merit and drowns out any actual discussions because each comment thread is so removed from the overall posts thread  thats just how it has always been  imo  i disagree with the redditquette stuff  i agree it was talked about more  but people still widely behaved the same as they do now   downvote of they disagree or dont like 

i can get on board with bots being more prevalent  what problem and why am i part of it

are all 10 year beta part of the problem  but you will not get a confidence interval that matches the numbers given in this article  this is a stock sub if you want to discuss angry politics theres a subreddit for that  people are getting tired of the constant rage and drama 


 people just voted for chaos over calm they love the rage and drama people want a wwe reality tv government  so why are people leaving x in massive numbers  im sorry but k dont think you get how business works 

you can expand if youve already capture the ys market without expanding to other counties  wow thats a lot of meme stocks but youre making a great profit congrats have you read reddits recent earnings reports though their growth is not tied to us politics as much as youd think their international growth is great too and the growth is expected to continue as a heavy reddit user who rarely goes to the politics subs i find reddit super valuable i also believe a lot more people will join reddit because of that  the fun thing about investing is you can place your money where your mouth is

i think youre wrong  engagement is way up and will remain that way while trump makes the 99 liberal hive mind reddit furious 

well find out next yr  remindme 1 year  go to the big subs and sort by top posts of all time

look at upvote counts and comments its pretty clear  whats your point   however im not going to let the tyranny of the stupid who are overly susceptible to misinformation be the arbiter of intelligence

lol as if reddit doesnt fit this bill go to a subreddit for something youre an expert on and youll find how much bullshit is on this site rscience is full of idiotic statistical takes statistics is my degree and most political subreddits are full of nonsense too 

this is basically the whole point being made above you  the echo chambers on reddit lead people to the conclusion that they are enlightened and everyone else is stupid because of the constant reinforcement of their own beliefs in their little echo chamber youre demonstrating the point if you truly think reddit is separated from the misinformation and stupidity  reality has a leftleaning bias too

the funny thing is i cant point out the very obvious things that make this wrong because i would get banned

its also funnysad that colbert said this in jest and now its been telephone gamed so much people think its an actual fact and being leftleaning is very different than what it was 10 years ago  ive been here since the digg days and its changed drastically prior to 2012 or so it wasnt even political people just got along and discussed shit around then it started going downhill because it became more mainstream itd be obviously astroturfed theyd try to monetize the site etc then around 2015 it became a shell of its former self thats when things become heavily political and the bots and shills political viral marketing everything overran the site to the point it doesnt even look organic anymore and that has continued ever since  my point is that the engagement on reddit i believe this year is related to politics im sure youre upset and reported me karen  x hit all time highs but many accounts deleted after election paid shills or bots it happened on most platforms 

httpswwwyahoocomtechxlostrecordnumberusers212509865html  meme stocks right  i dont disagree with your investment in reddit  i bought it very early and im currently up a significant amount i just find the reasoning behind the investment a bit amusing i have been a heavy reddit user for a long time and in my opinion it provides most value to me out of all the social networks i use im putting my money where my mouth is too just from a different perspective  youre a conservative investing in a liberal shithole you deserve to lose your money 

i bought cheap 100 calls on djt for next year the price has consolidated nicely if they announce theyre buying a crypto exchange or it goes for another big pump im gonna make a ton whenever it pumps to 50 those go for 8 to 10 look at jan 17th 100 calls for the year  happened 3 times last year  i will be messaging you in 1 year on 20251129 000339 utchttpwwwwolframalphacominputi202511292000033920utc20to20local20time to remind you of this linkhttpswwwredditcomrstockscomments1h1x2ajreddit_overtakes_x_in_popularity_of_social_medialzhi2m9context3

  nah i will rely on earnings reports instead of your data analysis  bill maher was saying this in the 90s  not exactly a new idea  spot on 20142015 is when the change happened there was an admin post talking about new sponsors and announcing default subs basically censored and cleaned up subs that people without an account would see first ever since then the site has gone downhill  you sure do make a lot of false assumptions  yeah i was planning on buying the ipo for that reason  i wasnt liquid tho was all in on a tiktok getting banned play  secured a 3bagger but short term options so tax man take half

think theres still plenty of room tho  so much hate dude ill sell my reddit once you stop using the site all because something is a liberal shithole doesnt mean you shouldnt invest in it trump winning was probably better than harris for reddit stock these social media companies thrive off engagement and negativity from people like you  deleted",0.0784,0.9997,0
Is there a realistic scenario where you would sell all your stocks? ,"to be 100 clear im not talking about an armageddon scenario total nuclear war extinction level meteor etc 

for me the only situation i can think of that would have me hitting the sell button would be a chinese invasion of taiwan this would likely bring us into world war 3 especially if it happens in the next 5 years 

any other realistic scenarios that would have you hitting sell ",LuxGang,2024-11-28 23:57:42,244,424,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h22eal/is_there_a_realistic_scenario_where_you_would/,,"probably not all but somemost for a payment on a home  id rather just buy more at a steep than trying to time things you know soon as you sell because of some black swan event the money printer go brrrrrr and rates crash back down to zero this reinflating everything all over again  probably not if we are ever at the point where i think selling everything is a good idea the market has probably already dropped 80 and i would be too busy trying to find water and ammunition to care about my portfolio  i only sell stocks when i need money to buy somethingthe best place to recoup losses in stocks is to stay in the stock market
  
  
for individual stocks i would sell if i lost confidence in business direction or leadership  if i was staring outside my window on the morning of 911 and saw a plane plow into the world trade center id probably immediately try to sell everything if the market hadnt reacted yet aside from that scenario i wouldnt sell  war is bullish though  by the time you know about it the big boys will have sold and you sell low  the only thing that would make me liquidate is an alien invasion  if china invades taiwan buy amat and asml 

the world is about to need a lot of new semi fabs  youre completely backwards on the invasion of taiwan war is hell for everyone except investors throw everything into ba rtx noc and lmt  retire by the end of the war  when not if  nvda gets back to 1000 ill sell half btc im holding as generational wealth for my son  my other stocks would contemplate cleaning slate in 4 years depending how the election would turn out and rebuilding a different portfolio  i think the economy will stay cooking for a bit but the incoming administration policies are going to wreak havoc on the market 

taiwan well need to wait a bit and see how ukrainerussia war plays out if china invades taiwan theyll see crippling embargos from the western world they dont have the food supply to feed their massive population which means theyd be relying on russia their primary fellow authoritarian ally and trading partner if russia secures a significant portion of the bread basket land of ukraine that would enable china to invade taiwan it would also show that western support dries up after a few years if the wests support of ukraine allows them to continue the territorial stalemate china will think twice about invading taiwan i think theyre unlikely to do anything in taiwan without food supply secured  did you sell when russia invaded ukraine if not why sell when china invaded taiwan  yes but theyre personal not geopolitical

if my wife or i needed lifesaving treatment for some disease if i was fighting a lawsuit or court case where i knew i was not liable or guilty etc

realistically speaking those probably wouldnt deplete my whole portfolio though  if china goes to war with taiwan there would be a large sell off this would present a fantastic buying opportunity that i would take advantage of just like i have for 911 2008  covid 20212022 and everything in between see a pattern here sitting on the sidelines when everyone is living in fear means you miss out  in any scenario bad enough to justify that wed all have way bigger worries than the stock market  sure when i need the money for some concrete expense house purchase being a popular one 


theres no other geo political event i think that would cause that thats called panic selling and that is exactly what causes market crashes its like how rubbernecking causes traffic jams if no one panic sold there wouldnt be any crashes you know it will go back up and if the issue is is that its your retirement funds and its close by thats why you should ease  into something more fixed a certain amount of years out  my entire roth ira was tsdd i sold it all ah on election night so for one day i was all cash 

i plan to go all cash on inauguration day or before possibly 

my roth ira is up 380 ytd almost entirely momentum trading leveraged nvda and tsla so i could sit on cash for the next 4yrs and still be ahead of average expected returns just patiently waiting for another great opportunity  sadly i think the absorption of taiwan into china will be much less dramatic  it will involve lots of drama but in the end will happen a little like hong kong a timetable the rich will get out those who havent already and then whimper beijing runs taiwan  fwiw i believe thats why tsmc is building its best and biggest plant in arizona  you never know until its too late so the obvious example now is if trump gets on the tariff pedal a little bit too hard creates an inflationary environment that turns into demand destruction which then turns into rapidly decelerating inflation but at the same time rapidly decelerating earnings if that happens yeah you dont want to be in stocks you want to be in bonds but bonds are going to be scary because the initial part of this is likely to see them sell off unless thats what weve already seen because lets face it tlt is not exactly ripping 

but heres the problem with all of it dude could change his mind tomorrow everything i just said out the window everythings fine thats the problem with so many of these when should i sell scenarios they usually have a very difficult or very quick rebound or turnaround or something of that nature so not only do you have to sell the right time but you also have to figure out when youre getting back in  in those cases i will be buying even more stocks even leveraging myself to the hilt as those are black swans once in a lifetime opportunities most of my gains came from the covid era having the luck that i have bought great companies at low prices they al took off still wish i had more money back then because all stocks were on sale 

from my healthcare holdings to my toiletpaper stocks kmb pg cl clx to my energy chemicals to my transport my defence rtx and even my etf vwrl even my crypto and pm fared well from there on

a wise banker who was the father i never had once said the time to buy is when theres blood in the streets  and good ole buffet be greedy when others are fearfull be fearfull when others are greedy  if i get to a number i feel is safe to be able to put into a stable income fund like jepi and earn enough off dividends alone to live comfortably i will sell  i sold all my stocks when i bought our house  my wife aks me how much we would have if we didnt selli explain about 150 but we wouldnt have a house  

but we are back to 50 portfolio value prehouse so getting there  man if china invades taiwan i will wait a bit for people like you to panic sell and then buy big  every value investor i follow is holding at least 20 cash right now  we wouldnt go into war to defend taiwan we already have plans at the ready to evacuate all essential chip employees and their families thats all we need from the island so thats all well protect  finally to buy a home  i cant think of one but on the other hand id never say never either  warren buffett has been selling his stock for a while now and has created hundreds of billions in cash reserves  this was a hedge against this last election  if harris won his taxes would go up especially capital gains but since he cashed out he paid the lower rate and when he bought back in his new stock would be debiased  with trump winning he can just hold the cash and look into a few opportunities that might emerge between deportation and tariffs wracking the economy  liquid net worth of 4m live comfortably off interest win at capitalism  i do so regularly for a week or a few days and just yolo it in stocks that are super bullish just to get a good return and then go back in its worked out quite well  i wouldnt sell i would buy more  every november to get around wash sale rules and lock in losses for tax reasons  if i got fired obviously not mankind level bad but id put everything into schd and spyi to pay even just a few bills every month  yeah right now at the top of the market because i dont see how see a 30 yearly gain isnt going to melt away soon im betting in two years the market will be in the same place as it is now my 401k is for the long term  if i knew the exact hour of my deathlike if i bought a digital watch from a trinket store in chinatown and one morning it started counting down or something  if they invaded taiwan im selling and yolo into lockheed and other ethical companies  direct attack on american soil by another first world country  

i dont know enough about geopolitics to accurately predict inciting events for world war 3 and neither do any of you  but ill be happy to buy your shares at a heavy discount if you think you do  if i needed money for medical expenses for my family to live that would be about it otherwise i just wont sell  i sold all my bitcoin which was a little bit more than 1 coin at 35000 to buy a house stings now that its up to 100000 and i have the double whammy of a high interest rate relative to my peers and neighbors  hate to say it but the us aint gonna start ww3 over taiwan  not all but ill consider selling a large portion were trump to fire jerome powell to appoint someone who takes orders from him central bank independence is critical to both capitalist democracy and the functioning of the stock market  i sold all my stocks and etfs for bitcoin back in 2022 best decision ever  if a president threatened to place punitive tariffs on our best trading partners and expel agricultural laborers leading to hyperinflation recession and dollar collapse

but that could never happen right  op i am literally only investing in crypto and stocks as a savings account to buy land to homestead and get away from it all a savings account is safer and my crypto was depressing for two years but i have finally reached a point that i will likely be selling vast majority of everything by this springsummer when we sell our house and all investments will keep a few things and have a mehhh 401k but will have acres in the mountains paid off and only need to worry about property taxes

so i am looking forward to the day to sell most of it all off  lol usa is not going to war with china over taiwan and certainly not trump hes a coward which is probably a good thing  a realistic scenario  no   the market is the reason that i was able retire   but taking out chunks of cash for larger purchases will happen  all no i have a diversified portfolio

large sections yes there are lots of scenarios where id pull out of one or more industries totally  no  my family was starving and no other way to feed them was available 

what coud cause this scenario 

some kind of global nuclear war where all the superpowers are launching nukes at each other but by then it may be too late to care about food  if a nuclear war did happen what is the most realistic thing you can even do i mean you are probably gonna die but  possibly once the stock has grown enough to take out the same value as your initial investment then let the rest ride  pandemic shutdown  the only time you should consider selling your stocks is during a severe global crisis or if the us is economically depegged from its reserve status at that point convert cashbased assets into tangible resources  i would sell everything if my family is in trouble and need the money  everyone says they wont sell but everytime it crashes for some reason there is a lot of selling hard to hold if an individual stock goes down 30 in a day  i only buy indexs for anything that matters so i would let it ride through anything anything that tanks an index long term means money wont matter either i only invest in individual stocks with my fun money account and mostly invest in tech i believe in so nothing would make me sell those  i wonder how tlt and bonds in general would react to war  when marty was trying to run away from the cartel  if all of them were to hit my stop loss then yes  already hit that button once didnt work out so well  if i knew there was a huge market crash coming i would just sell my entire portfolio and then buy back in at a lower price after the crash  i would never conisider selling all of them been there done that with regret but if its time to rebalance the portfolio and sell stuff ahem tsla for a better opportunity i would  if im super rich 100m and about to retire thats about the only situation  theres an old saying buy on the sound of cannons sell on the sound of trumpets

personally theres no situation where id sell everything unless i was broke  as a big fan of taiwan you put to much importance on taiwan if taiwan would be nuked tomorrow sure semiconductors would be expensive af but life would go on stocks would go on and factories would start building their fabs closer to home  i would buy more if thats to happen lol you can get rich during those times  i think you are letting  fear take over your space  i sell when i deem a company to be over priced or im dropping it due to it going to shit its highly unlikely to happen to all the companies i own at the same time that being said i sold more than 23 of my positions earlier this year but also bought new ones  serious illness  not for me im holding until i die if i can  if they gave you exemption for cgt only reason i sell slowly and just let it build up  yes when i have enough the pay off my house and retire  yes
very early february 2020 is the textbook example of such scenarios  if u had enough in equities that my investments were fully self sustaining i would sell all my stocks and go 100 into risk free income  being terminally ill knowing the rough expiry date and wanting to have a last hurray  im doing what warren buffett did im pretty much going down to half cash  there is nothing that you could do to make me sell everything even if the world was ending i would be buying  ive done it numerous times when it was profitable to do so  that said my account for trading equities is just a side thing really its my savings account that yields a hell of a lot more than a savings account would  for actual longterm investing i have traditional things like a 403 that i leave alone  ive done this twice in my life the first time unfortunately out of necessity  in the scenario when you wouldnt want to own us equities there would be no other asset in the us worth holding  the whole world as you know it is coming to an end   otherwise just stay in the market  i just did my wife and i are buying an apartment   yeah if it jacks up to 100 mil then why not  huh timing the market  not a good strategy  however many ceos are cutting some of their positionsbut having a good diversified portfolio lets your sleep at night  end of 2025 sell everything and wait in cash  berkshire goes 100 cash  when the next pandemic starts rolling around and the government decides to start shutting the world down again  i have 1 invested in nvidia and im never selling to the moon  i had bad memories of past where last time i tried to sell all to buy lower the price skyrocketed and never visit back close to the price i sold i ended up missing a few yearly salary of gains now i just do hedge trading for my short term account i can be shorterm short with a stop loss on a short term account without selling my long term portfolio at all  no investment is safe and being in cash is many times better than in stocks when warning signs start piling up i can get back in progressively anyone who says you cant time the market doesnt know how  if i lost my job couldnt find one for months and was on the verge of starving and losing my home  remember november 2021  i will sell all my stocks when companies decide corporate greed isnt a priority  so in other words never  a chinese invasion of taiwan will not start anything the next 4 years someone gave them a blank check there will be no world war  in the event of world war 3 the only recourse would be to place our heads between our legs and kiss our ass goodbye

no world war would stay nuclear free for long  if spy hits 750 next year only 25 not completely impossible i would consider it but probably just hedge a lot more with otm put spreads  ive sold majority of my portfolio on 4 occasions to buy houses cash now theyre all paid for and im building my accounts back up to probably just drain them again its a time lol  yes if a virus starting spreading rapidly somewhere and i thought it was only a matter of weeks or months until another global shutdown  by the time you learn of a major event the markets would have already collapsed  i recently have but not for any particular reason other than i wanted to secure profits and better condense a portfolio that was starting to have too many positions  aside from long term accounts like retirement college etc i sell stocks when the return on initial investment has reached a point im comfortable realizing the reinvesting in either another growth stock a long term stock or if i feel like just buying some random thing  buying a house  my kid had to sell all their stock before starting a new job allowed to have mutual funds and etfs but no individual stocks  if the chinese invade taiwan triggering wwiii youre gonna have bigger fish to fry then worrying about stocks currencies too will get hit anyways and gold may be unattainable crypto will have issues as well if the internet is disrupted which it will be if theres a world war  the us government makes a new law to impose strict restrictions on the stock market  investors are only allowed to sell less than 10k of stock per day  yeah if i go up another 50 this year ill count my lucky stars and bow out for a minute  yes if they all shot up 50 overnight id liquidate immediately  buy a house or make any other large investment outside of the stock market

i get old and the time value of money is worth less than the experiences i can have with it now

i have advanced knowledge of a market crippling event that wont kill the dollar along with it  no  if thats the case im buying lockheed martin  easier option is to not invest much in taiwan stock market  im actually about to sell everything before the end of the year or at least a lot of it to lock in my gains at the rate they qualify 0 live in a us territory that doesnt tax gains  its a complicated situation that 99999 of people arent in but essentially if life throws me a curve ball i want to realize my tax liability or lack there of now  ill rebuy a new portfolio in jan  it will be sad to sell some long holds like nvidia but it needs to be done  when my future index predictor says run  already have several times since covid everyday i read a new article that can convince me to panic sell my entire life  when i am reaching my retirement age i will be selling and rebalancing into something like a target date fund  nuclear war and stocks are worth nothing  only if they start taxing unrealized capital gains then im going all into gold and committing tax fraud  if i have enough in there to pay off my full student loans  buy ktos  2695 thank me later  trump is going to be really volatile but since hell probably appease the libertarian tech bros voo will stay strong so probably just something catastrophic  sure 

 us government defaults on its debts sudden wave of bank failures credit dries up get what i can for the stocks put it in gold and live in a cave for the next 20 years

 companies just start to get nationalized imagine one day the government just decides it wants to own all of the railroads for national securities interest they seize the railroads without any payment like is standard with eminent domain then i dont know what i own anymore  and want to get out quickly  russia uses a tactical nuke in ukraine sell stocks buy btc  yes for important lifestyle things house car holiday kids tuition ect its very important to take profits or else whats the point things can go wrong to take small profits along the way  if i can immediately pay off my debts in relative full then yes

ive considered a percentage threshold but theres no guarantee it wont go higher with a bit more patience the same could be said to its inverse though

i think the difference being i could live with the former and would be stuck wondering what if on the latter  im selling a huge chunk now this market feels so frothy and so overbought trump pump has happened all my indicators are screaming greed ive got a feeling 2025 is going to be ugly  no  if they keep hitting my limitsells i will keep selling them homelessness would cause me to sell them all at in e though for sure  if s4912  bitcoin act of 2024 passes 

httpswwwcongressgovbill118thcongresssenatebill4912text  nope ww2 was a good time to invest who says ww3 wont be as warren buffett says dont bet against the us

you can borrow against your portfolio to finance a house 

never ever sell a wonderful company  world wars with the right portfolio create a lot of wealth  if someone got elected who i believed was going to put general tariffs on our three biggest trading partners and deport 40 of construction workers and 30 of farm workers i would consider getting out of the us market for a little while yeah  bonds yielding 810  no  yes i just did it for peace of mind also to reorganize my thoughts i have tons of losses this year so realizing them is fine 

besides after the next brief run up theres a high potential for divestment into sector pullback not guaranteed at all plenty of brinksmanship but everyone is going to go bubble up as soon as the next wind of gdp stagnation rears its head because thatll mean economic contraction in a potential inflationary run up with low unemployment thats like the perfect storm setup for stagflation  it would only make sense to sell if you know before everyone else that china will invade taiwan once its public the crash will have already happened and youd have to hold to make sure you dont miss the recovery 

many people lose money trading because they get caught up in the moment and forget how the market really works if you read something on bloomberg remember that the hedge funds knew about it hours before you and theyve already traded away the advantage  ive sold all my stocks in the past when prices indicated overvaluation in historical terms and fixed income was paying relatively well like now

i think were overdue for a recession and trump policies provide many possible ways to enter one and for it to last a long time so i think there will be lower valuations in the future  by the way taiwan would probably not even be invaded or at least theyd first probably just blockade the crap out of taiwan like a literal siege the chinese military has absolutely 0 experience in warfare whatsoever especially an amphibic attack like the one that would need to be attempted for taiwan just look at how bad the russian military is in ukraine  just enough for a house and a car i would cash out for me thats a big advantage in life on the long run  let it ride honestly ive seen the math behind if you miss the best 10 or best 20 trading days over several decades your gains are pretty much gone i dont think theres any reason id sell everything timing the market is impossible unless youre in congress

case in point back when my portfolio was worth 250k it jumped from 250k to 300k over the course of a few weeks i was super heavy in the mag 7 at the time and tesla along with the rest of them went ape shit for a solid month had i been in a sold all scenario during that parabolic mag7 period id have missed out on the big climb gains  not sure about china invading taiwan would result in world war 3 china has stated that taiwan is part of their country and they will take it one way or another so it is inevitable 

  
my only realistic scenario is that i will need all my funds for some sort of health emergency  august 2007 pulled all my money off the market after months of hearing about the downfall of the mortgagebacked securities scheme and our governments refusal to even acknowledge it the final straw was hearing hannity and limbaugh declare it a democrat lie and keep your money on the market that told me which way the gop was going the old bury your head in the sand and pretend it never happened approach really liked mccain as a person after working with his staff a few times but voted for obama because the gop was so toxic  6500 sp within next 6 months  maybe if i move back to my home country would maybe sell them before moving to avoid tax  sure when i buy stock and make a deep dive into the company i also formulate an exit condition ie some sort of situation the company is in at which point i think it no longer has room to grow sufficiently quickly to merit my further investment if all those conditions are hit for all the stocks i own at the same time which isnt too unlikely since i have only shares in two companies at present then i would sell it all 

there might also be some emergency situation where i need a lot of cash cant really think of one now but maybe some opportunity that is too good to pass up

pretty sure selling your stock would not be an option in an armageddontype scenario  i believe that if i leave my country to another the government treats my investments and a deemed disposition so they will tax me on it even if i dont want to sell it 

so that is when i would have to sell  no  

anything that actually would cause our economy to dissolve would make money meaningless so why would you care about stocks and other financial instruments  retired ive sold 90 to put into monthly cash flow alternative investments i can see the possibility of putting the remainder of stocks to other uses  its not bitcoin where there is some huge cult making selling some kind of failure its a thing i do to make money  i invest outside of my 401k only for the purpose of raising money for the downpayment and premove in renovations of our house once we are ready to buy yes i will sell absolutely everything  if there were an asset class that was sure shot win maybe  the thing is you would have been too late to press the sell button  idk if you lost trust in the countries government is something  if one of my side businesses found market fit and i could turn a cash infusion into growth i wouldnt hesitate for a second to dump my stocks 

liquididating for an unproven business idea however i would probably not do although that might change as my 401k get meatier over the years  its like 140k now and im able to afford the max yearly contribution finally i keep around 4060k in non retirement funds half of that in the markets half in high intestate savingscd laddersbonds etc whatever i can get around 5 on risk free  

there is also a world where say in several years from now i end up with 500k in my 401ks i might quit my job just so i can do an ira conversion then use the ira to buy a multifamily with proceeds from rent getting reinvested back into the markets  i have done this  are you looking for advice on when to panic sell  yeah if i was single and had a terminal diagnosis im pulling the plug on the savings and getting a sports bike sports car and a lot of speeding tickets  at market open  trump winning the election  sure retirement  hmm theres this unrealistic scenario where trump got reelected and is imposing insanely massive tariffs on all trading partners while driving inflation by deporting all cheap labor after the market entered unchartered overvaluation levels  yeah if bitcoin hits 1 million then i will sell all of my investments its all bitcoin  retirement home killing a mortgage after fully retiring big life changes or an emergency  i cashed out half to buy a home and i may need to cash out some more for a destination wedding  to buy a house without a mortgage i would  to buy a home  you only sell if you think its going to be a sustained drop and to evaluate that for every stock

worst case scenario you have everything in cash for a year and a half because of some huge recession and you sit on minimal gains

reinvesting bits of it carefully



i think when inflation hit with the virus one of my more unhinged friends i think yanked out 90 of his crummy stock portfolio

yowling a few times like trying to catch a falling knife

and then he dumped it into a dozen etfs

questionable stuff like crypto etfs and asia growth lol

mind you he bought high risk companies refused all largecap stocks as not profitable enough once person i knew who went into a panic



its hard to predict an economic meltdown and how quick or slow itll act on your stocks  down payment to buy a house  lately ive been considering liquidating my brokerage  crypto to buy a 7plex in a metro that i think has significant upside 1 hour from where i live would be about 40 down so im sure i could pay the remaining off in 1015 years i already own another rental property so have the process down i am in a great spot with my 401k and company stock as well and real estate is just infinitely more fun for me personally something about owning a bad ass downtown brick building that will be a cash flow beast forever makes me happy anyways thats all i would consider selling for id think or a catastrophic issue  no scenario unless my life was on the line  for me the only situation i can think of that would have me hitting the sell button would be a chinese invasion of taiwan

in which case youd be selling after the big boys have already sold and no one is buying so youre selling into a hugely discounted market why would anyone do that its like selling right after the covid crash

so no unless i really really really need the cash for personal reasons  nope if shit critical leverage it for a loan  did it with my personal small portfolio a couple years ago when i got severed from job and took 16mos to find another one had to keep the bills paid and had way too many bigger expenses in play that ate up the cash sucked but that was what it was there for if needed and it was  no if that scenario happens war stocks like hii rtx will appreciate a lot  yea i did it just as the pandemic hit  im slowly selling about 80 because my partner and i bought a house  when warren buffet donates 10 billion dollarsto me  funny  these events make me think about picking up a heloc and throwing every single available dollar into buying more stocks

if there is one thing i have learned about investing

you make pretty good money sticking to a good passive static asset allocation of index funds  you make great money throwing more money into that same plan when sht is hitting the fan  when the market is down 2008 2020 etc is when i was throwing a ton of money into the market  i love it when the market tanks  

in the immortal words of jack bogle vanguard founder paraphrasing fast do something stand there and do nothing  ponder what he meant and it will make you a better investor  no  now  all indicators point to vastly overpriced stocks and the economy on the point of a deep depression full time jobs down gross house debt student debt bubbles trumps plans for tarriffs and mass deportations will tank the economy and rekindle inflation  i sold off my stocks  why would anyone sell in a potential nuclear armageddon either it happens and it doesnt matter that you liquidated because youre dead or it doesnt happen and youve just sold all your stocks at a huge loss because the market shat its pants  im struggling with a decision i have enough investment money to pay off my kids college loans theyre my parental loans assigned to me not my kids in a side rh account mostly made up of nvidia however i dont want to touch it for numerous reasons i e nvidia has more money to make me great financial cushion etc i have a pension and im still working and putting money into two 401ks that currently has more than what i owe in parental loans the interest is about 7 on average 

im 61 should i pay it off or just make a high monthly payment 3k until i die and the loan automatically disappears in my demise my other option is to leverage the rh account and get a loan and pay off the college loans and just deal with the bank interest should be lower  recently i made a rash decision to take on financing a car had a really nice rate in the dealership wanted it that night and ended up dropping 1k from my personal bank savings to front a down payment

i pulled all stocks that i had this doesnt include 1k that i put down to have a safety net for any feestroubles if things are safe ill reinvest it

i think of the stock money as money that grows personally for me and if i need all of it i take all of it probably not the best idea for some but its working great for me now  china invading taiwan would instigate sanctions dont be silly about ww3

usa europe would not go to war over taiwan despite what they say

they couldnt keep up an attack around chinas waters their blue water fleet would take major hits and weaken the usa military projection worldwide  there wont be a world war 3 because of that the americans are free to invade any country they want without the risk of starting a world war  taxes stop me from selling would gladly sell and move to less risky investments but its not worth 40 i live in california  there was a rumor years ago about bail ins if the entire banking system failed i would try to cash out 100 if i knew that was the case  yeah if i could sense a crash is happening then once the dust settles i would put everything in a good leveraged nasdaq fund and ride the next wave up but this time with leverage bear markers average 812 months bull anywhere between 510 and never less than 3 years in fact the 2 year bull market from 20202022 was the only one in history that went less than 3  end jan 2020 after person to person covid in germany  i will 100 in fixed income before trump raises his right hand  currently im completely diversified into gme i have some in a broker and some drsed in computershare

i would 100 sell all my shares when the real short squeeze happens  and then buy back in afterwards  removed  if 10 year treasuries yield above 10 i will go all in on bonds the risk reward is not worth it  i got guns ammo and rice i will use my money to buy your fire sale stocks thank you very much  all i can say is that you hit the button that many other smart people already anticipated but and big but not everyone may be lucky to know ahead of time i am lucky for the broad global population the hours it takes to realize and grasp imagine after hours the markets can open with a 3070 drop overnight and selling is before late so the key is selling when suspecting it not it about to happen then another problem happens risk of hyperinflation all within weeks or until the crisis resolves so one has to be ready to convert the  in real estate eg mortgage payout or gold again gold will shoot up when it looks imminent i think i may sell99 of everything and keep 1 unit just to know how much they drop

and then if someone has 30 of stuff in options that cannot be called what do they do shortsellers will be happy

for your second point market highs when approaching a clear correction should be it or at least 30 when i watch over a year a portfolio be down 2030 from a  high i kick myself for not having sold knowing it was a high never again especially  given how many people are saying tarrifs will destroy the economy now is a good time  i was tempted when trump got elected again  if socialists like kamala take power and enact a wealth tax 

we will all have to sell a large percent of our stocks each year just to pay the tax  going through this right now it hurts as i worked hard to build it all up but heyanother asset class i guess  did this in 2022 to buy my first home sold about 40 of my portfolio for a 20 down payment on the home in hindsight it was a great move got in before interest rates took off and the value of my home has gone up 50k in 25 years  i sold all my portfolio 3 months ago which was about 80k we used 30k on a house downpaymeny but my thought was that we needed the extra 50k on hand if we needed to dig into savings for unexpected expenses or to supplement our mortgage payments for whatever reason until interest rates go down and we can refinance im kicking myself so hard for being that aggressive with selling i should have kept at least 30k in the market if anything to avoid paying taxes on realized gains i learned a valuable lesson this year which is if you have the risk tolerance to hold and you have solid investments then hold

it stings even worse that a lot of stuff i had blewww up like reddit ionq olko to name a few now i just need to stop looking at what i would have made if i held you live and you learn also fml  i did that 3 years ago now laying in bed in the house i own bought with a down payment i made on shares  part of it   i sold my aapl stock on 2013 to buy a home  same going to liquidate most of mine for a down payment its absurd how much i need for a starter  thats what i did in 2022 good timing but the fomo lately has me itching to get back into day trading  i sold 75 of my port to buy our house in 2019 in hindsight it worked out but i was hella depressed about it for the first year able to compartmentalize it but didnt like thinking about it  remember how grim taxes are the next year sold 800k ish a few years back next years taxes were 200k  im going towant to do the same this is wishful thinking but i was hoping my nvda investment will 10x in the next 510 years and then i can use that for a down payment on a house instead of having to sell my whole portfolio lol  this is my plan i have a house now but want a big upgrade double the size funds from the sale  most of my investments should be enough to buy one with cash outright or at the very least a mortgage around 100150k after down payment  i sold all my stocks because i needed all that money to buy my home it was the cheapest one i could find that i wanted to actually live in given what i was holding i might have become a multi millionaire if i kept holding for the last 5 years but i probably would have sold after doubling my money and my home has increased in value to the point where i wouldnt be able to afford buying it today even if i had doubled my money in my investment account  i agree there are those who do not  on twitterx a multitude of obsessivecompulsive people in the investing community there have shunned this idea they would rather rent all their lives because they argue more money can be made in stock appreciation than home appreciation investing has essentially taken over their lives become the 1 priority they may be right about the appreciation but ive used stocks to finance 3 homes and if i could go back and do it again i wouldnt do it differently  yeah  ill sell everything no second thoughts   for me i wish it would have been when i got 20 above where i needed to be to have a happy retirement  im saving aggressively in cds and other cash equities for a house the next couple years but i could theoretically double to triple my down payment size if i sell my stocks really torn on what to do  give up cash flow to acquire debt i rather avoid this scenario buying a rental is a different story  yep govt works to serve the rich who predominately have their wealth in stocks they will cause inflation to be 6 before they let stocks stay 30  so then whats the point if you never sell  im not sure id be able to tell it wasnt an accident tho  i watched 911 live on tv even after the 2nd tower was hit there were reporters as well as many people who thought that it might be some kind of technical issue not a terrorist issue so even seeing something happen in real time we may not grasp the gravity of the situation  hopefully youre not in the south tower  if theres a war with china im not selling my lockheedmartin  war is bullish if the war is not happening on your soil which for the us is always the case  heh nice one  space aliens like to buy stocks  if mars attacks its bullish  100 unless there is a natural disaster of disproportionate scale that materially threatens the survival of the human species there will always be an opportunity in any crisis

like you mentioned defense stocks are good in war even in the russia ukraine oil stocks also saw a solid run due to the economic context of the conflict if we apply this logic to taiwan then id assume tsmc is cooked and well readjust as such

covid pandemic pharma obviously only thing would be guessing which one gets development done first and the vaccine mandate

911 defense again  thank you that was an excellent example of the many layers of information that are needed to make informed decisions about investing  russia is financially bankrupt and the area of ukraine that they would get in a deal is essentially worthless without a major costly rebuild  right now a large part of chinas economy depends on us trade  take that away and they have no reason to hold off an invasion  trade with russia will be worthless so their only option will be to use their power to expand into all of se asia  trump will intimidate to satisfy his followers but ultimately will not push the trade wars  some of what you say is true but china has been stock piling grain for years and has more than half the worlds supply in reserves and something ridiculous like enough to feed their population for two years a diet change maybe but starving probably not they are also very efficient in producing grain oil is more of a concern for them if anything and a need from russia  iran is another factor here trump did a lot of brinkmanship and sabre rattling with then last time and it did result in tanker attacks and that bombing of the saudi oil field that sent prices up for a bit  if he does that again and given his strong support for israel he might be inclined to do this again to appear tough  fucking with the oil there would increase prices but might also bail out the domestic oil industry if they have overproduction issues

on the other hand irans president is a moderate right now and maybe if they make some concessions trump will back off but trump is too fickle to make a deal he can stick to and constantly undermined the negotiations his own people were doing  but if you have money to buy doesnt that mean you are sitting on the sidelines  question numro uno whats your current investment to sideline cash ratio are there moments where despite seeing market being insanely bullish yu choose not to invest only to make use of these black swan events for which yu need capital on the side line  thats why buffet is sitting on all thats cash  waiting for china to make him even richer   sure but if 30 of sp caps go bankrupt one buys not just a selloff but about to die unit  just waiting for your tax bill too  i used to be that way but the 35 gain in the past year in etfs alone is a lot to miss out on  american prestige as the superpower and an ally also depends on what they do with taiwan upon chinese invasion you are being far too smooth about the possibility of a war here  what about the tshirts and shoes   doritos is a national treasure fuck fritos  like cds or what  what do you mean lock in losses do you sell all of your losers for the year and keep the winners does that have a significant impact on your tax returns  is it worth getting smacked by cap gains taxes tho  should have bought rklb instead  trump would go to war  if musk and all the other billionaires in his government could profit from it 

barron wont have to go though he has preemptive bone spurs  when the nukes start dropping we aint selling shit  money  especially online becomes inaccessible and meaningless  guns and ammo are the most valuable currency  how heavy is your bag great company though  lol is this still a thing  youre not diversified in one stock  internet explorer is that you  yes i too would go all in on spy returns risk free  so you are a billionaire or werent paying attention  wealth tax would never pass congress stop fear mongering  one you can live in  its like when people ask about stocks that give you some kind of shareholder benefit real estate gives you the shareholder benefit of living in the home  home  stocks  going through the exact same it sucks to sell almost everything but yeah into real estate plus if leveraged into real estate can get better returns  consider using your stocks as collateral to borrow money you increase risk debt management but can help avoid triggering cap gains  this is just asset swap  withdraw parts around the end of year and beginning to not have bigger tax hits in one year  if its any consolation houses appreciate in value by an average of 10 percent a year and you can sell at any time so its kinda like an etf just more complicated youre not throwing the money away  yeah youve not spent the money just transferred it to another form one that you can make practical use of too  this just happened to me lol  take a loan out against your portfolio  stocks are a means to an end not an end in and of itself  you can also shit into a bucket and fetch out your dental crown in privacy saved at least 500 there  classical smart thinking plan to use money within a hort timeline get the hell out happened to me in 2008 before i went to miami in july to look for a house to buy i liquidated 100 then the great recession happened 2 months later  better to be lucky than smart  
ps today since 90 of my assets are in alternative investments and 5 in a hysa leaving 5 in equities i could sell it all without any immediate or future lifestyle risk whatsoever  how does it impact your daily life that the value of you house has gone up 50k genuine question i mean as long as you dont want to sell it can you use that more value in some way  except you sold at the market bottomthat low interest rate gain means you missed out on 25 annual returns over the next two years hindsight says you should have taken out a bigger mortgage  you get my sympathetic upvote   
  
your reasoning was sound and you slept well at night knowing that you could take care of any houserelated emergencies related to finance   
  
fortunately youve still got the knowledge that made you all that stock money so its very likely that youll do it again  i have about a 60k portfolio now the city im looking to buy in has a grant program that will give me 5 toward my purchase of the place if i meet certain criteria which i do one of them is that i cant have more than 50k leftover in investmentsavings accounts not including retirement after the purchase so im hoping to beef up my savings for a bit and just take out what i need from my investments to get me below that 50k max mark  tough to see stocks blow up like that similar thing with myself and wgs bought 1500 shares at 350 and sold it all at 30 only to watch it blow up to 80 feel your pain  if i never spent any money in my life i would be a multimillionaire dont feel bad my dood the market could have also crashed and you have a house  well what did you buy your home for and whats it worth now  yeah cant get a starter for less than like 350k now unless you are in some random place that probably sucks  no they dont  inflation is a tax  their real basis in a stock gets diluted by inflationary increases in stock price that increases their tax burden   and because lowering rates in a crisis is good policy not everything is a conspiracy man  to generate income from capital  even in an accident i think youd want to try to be the first to sell  yeah it was the second plane that made us all realize the situation  ive been thinking about buying that stock and i never buy individual stocks fr solely bc of how the world is rn  profiting from war is really gross  well maybe not always but like 95 of the time

who really wants to invade a country where guns outnumber the residents 1205 guns for every 100 americans and that was back in 2018 which is 46 of the worldwide total lol  i dont know that its really relevant how much money russia has in terms of the war as long as the factory workers keep running their shifts to make more weapons and they have more bodies to throw at the battlefield agree on the rebuild for industry in ukraine but farming recovers quickly and ports have value even if they need a full rebuild 

i dont think theyre holding off due to us trade personally but im sure its one of many factors i do think se asia is ripe for trade with them their evs are everywhere there even with 100 import tariffs i dont know what exactly his motivation is with the tariffs most of the theories i can come up with sound too adjacent to conspiracies but i do expect him to implement them on a whim and cancel them on a whim and some people will make money or consolidate ownership in the process  russia is far from bankrupt  who has 0 cash on the sidelines ever many ways to invest more during a crash immediately or a more aggressive dca  i have 20 percent in long term bonds and another 10 in jepi  spyi in the flight for safety i can sell the bonds and the hedges covered call portfolio and go long with spy the timing is tricky probably a dca plan over six months  you should always have some cash and stock you really shouldnt be all in on stocks and have 0 cash on hand probably a good 30 cash 70 stocks if you can manage it  ok whatever helps you sleep at night is your answer  i mean taiwan doesnt really have such intense support that it would create a world war on the scale of the first 2 i think if china started taking it further like attacking allied ships japanese islands we would start seeing things ramp up it would definitely cause global instability but also would depend on if its a bloody take over or just more of an anexxation  taiwan doesnt make shirts and shoes anymore  i assume so a money manager would handle that part if your annual cost of living is 4 or less than your current net worth thats when your money starts to really work for you 

my number is 4m  the war in syria would suggest that fuel and the ability to produce it is more valuable both is and the kurds had plenty of weapons but were capturing small oil wells and refineries to run everything fuel means mobility heat light tools cooked food pumped water etc  yep still massively shorted with naked short selling still rip for a massive short squeeze  obviously  comment of the week right here  why not both

the wealth tax like the income tax will expand to cover everyone  within 5 years school teachers will pay the wealth tax  its not fear mongering it was part of harris platform  if you remember when obamacare was passed and obama raised taxes senate leader schumer would repeatedly say millionaires and billionaires would be impacted with higher taxes  then when the legislation was finalized the magic threshold was 400k  now maybe you think if you make 400k you fall into the millionaire category but if you live in a hcol location pay high taxes and for childcare i can tell you youd be wrong the point is you cant trust politicians on either side of the aisle  hw bush said read my lips no new taxes and then raised taxes  

the op asked a hypothetical question about selling  i ran the numbers on my very large portfolio to understand the tax hit if i liquidated everything if i thought a tax on unrealized gains was coming  would i have sold everything  probably not but i would have sold some of my longterm holdings that have appreciated 700 

in addition i would sell everything i own in a heartbeat if i needed the money to help my family with a serious lifethreatening medical issue  one that you pay property taxes every year on and insurance plus maintenance costs no thanks  is there many stocks these days that offer many benefits  also the missed opportunity cost of not having your down payment invested  one should hope my plan is to roll the equity from this first house into a more custom build that will be our forever home already have the landbut its something to look forward to in 1015 years

im honestly just happy im even in a position to get a housei think my time will be forced to be spent on getting it ready to go versus checking the markets everyday  im in canada and due to being a first time home buyer with the relevant accounts i can actually withdraw my entire down payment total tax free i do have to return the amount specifically withdrawn from my retirement account over time however  is this only for the super rich or can anyone do this  oh absolutely i know it will be a solid investment my partner and i made sure its going to be a home first and foremost but it is in a desirable area so the resell value will be there just spooky making those big withdrawals and bank drafts  yes he cant just liquidate 50k of the value of his house  im not sure i understand the intent of what youre asking while i sold off a portion of my portfolio to buy my house another investment its nice to see that investment doing well  did not sell at market bottom lmao  ah that means a lot i slept very well which got me through the first time home buying process with a semblance of sanity i also put a dollar amount of the reduction in anxiety which is another way ive rationalized it very kind words and a hopeful perspective   oohh thats a very nice perspective he does have the knowledge on investments so he can do it again eventually in the future 

im currently considering paying off my housing loan but it would significantly affect my liquidity in a way that i would need to sell my stocks if theres an emergency im so torn because im anxious not having a proper liquid emergency fund if i use my savings account to fully pay my loan anyway still thinking it through  thank you for the kind words that is what my wife said and we ultimately feel good about the decision even though it doesnt lessen the sting i am grateful for what i have   no offense but this is just wrong

buying power gets diluted by inflation assets themselves like stocks gold homes increase with inflation incomes increase too but they lag inflation

so the people hit by inflation are those without assets that have to spend all their money on commodities rich people who own assets arent really hurt by it

im speaking straight up observed economics here not untested theory  hindsight literally everyone thought it was some accidentfluke  go for shld defence tech etf with palantir lockheed and more  you are profiting from war show me your portfolio and tech and many of them are derivatives from cold war winning western tech companies  they use our tax dollars to fund it so i might as well get something out of it   sent from phone made from slave labor  your name is gross

i didnt say i want a war with china  it would be horrible

this is the stocks forum  defense stocks will do well in a war  this is a fact  as they have during the awful war in ukraine 

if you dont like that go hang out in the poetry forum  price gouging essentials sure but stocks nah  but it is american  if i dont someone else will

moral high ground doesnt pay the billsthats just life  do you like gps  what about the internet  military technology does good for lots of areas  wrong sub pal  me has no cash on sidelines  any amount is money losing purchasing power  me   shouldnt your money be invested im not talking about ww3 where all stocks crash im talking about normal times like now so if theres a crash of a specific stock not all stocks then all you do is sell other stock which would have been in cash on the sidelines for you and buy the crash of that stock

why leave cash on the sidelines waiting  well good thing how we have republicans who will cause a crash and recession instead  yes and a wealth tax is unrealistic because its ridiculous and would never pass congress  yeah instead you should pay somebody elses property taxes and insurance and their maintenence costs  bro house gold voo is all you need at the end of your life all this shit is just to have that  yeah fuck that system shit i just relocated to a savannah living currently alongside cheetahs hunting and eating wildebeests and gazelles with self made spears and stone tools not a single fucking human being to piss me off around with their attitudes its a dream  agree restaurant dumpsters are way cheaper  around 80 of the sp500 give you dividends  if you own 100 shares of norwegian cruise line holdings ltd nclh you can get 50250 worth of onboard statement credit depending how long the cruise is lol  pot stocks offer various stages of benefits  i had two mutual friends who bought land outside of a rural town for dream homes they continued to pay a modest amount for property taxes until the area was annexed or amaglamated by the expanded regional muncipality as a consequence of the mike harris premiership then their property tax bill increased dramatically they continued to hold the land and paid increased property taxes until recently when the friends both separately had serious health issues a realtor somehow heard of their health issues and swooped down he lowballed the first friend badly and then lowballed the second friend less severely for the other piece of property the two mutual friends sold at fire sale prices since housing wasnt an issue for them and they were in truly no position to negotiate i believe the realtor and the realtors associates knew they were unwell what especially bothered me was that the realtor bought the adjoining properties for members of his own family only after he secured the sale did he produce the documents that revealed the conflict of interest and asked one of the mutual friends to sign a waiver which the friend did i hope your able to execute on your plans for a forever home id never ever invest in real estate for this reason as an investment as opposed to a place to live at least not in a town or rural area because ive seen firsthand how unethically and shady the realtors can act and how fickle the local market behaves  just 60000 not sure that is enough for a 20 downpayment maybe it is for a home in a remote part of nb or nfl or it buys you a tiny condo in a third tier town  idk what you define as super rich but you most banks have a 5060 ltv and a minimum line of 200k  yeah sorry i gonna educate myself a bit more dont want to confuse anybody but i dont understand what you have from it if the value of your house went up while still living in it if you dont sell it you have nothing from it but if you do sell it you wont have the house anymore you might have 50k more then before but houses around you went up too i assume can you use the property as security and does the higher value of your house gives you more room to play with it  its all a bottom compared to right now if you sold in jan 2022 then yes you were at the previous high  just think about the people who have the same problem as you but who dont have the knowledge or time to revisit the stock market and properly research stocks to buy   
  
youre making money to improve your life and solve your problems not to simply keep telling yourself that you have money  let me lay it out for you  asset purchased for 100 asset appreciates 10  during the same period inflation is 10 asset is sold for 110 which is a zero gain in real terms  however tax is still owed on the 10 gain turning the investment into a loss  if the investment increases in value 20 the tax is taken on the 20 not the 10 real inflation adjusted gain it is a real problem with safe low return long term investments  most people dont know how interconnected technological advancements and the military actually are like historically even  having integrity is hard but not impossible   do you have an emergency fund  i didnt give a percentage that i keep on the sidelines but its not much your method of selling stocks when needed makes sense 

im not arguing for a huge amount on the sidelines my initial comment was to express being against cashing out a portfolio if china invaded taiwan my point was that id let it ride and increasingly buy as it goes down lump what i can and dca 

a lot goes into what we want on the side too age comfort level people should do what works for them  nah he just lives with his parents  this is a terrible mentality to have when you go to eat at a restaurant or go shopping for clothes or pay for a plumber you are paying for someones property taxmortgageinsuranceetc 

you are exchanging money for a service or a good in this case its hopefully having a good home to live in  a landlord thats maintaining the propertyfixing issues in a timely manner 

in most places nowadays its cheaper to rent than to own and if you are able to invest the difference you could come out on top vs having owned a place plus its pretty nice that when something breaks you just call your landlord when youre a homeowner its on you  savannah georgia or like a real savannah   never fully understood this whats the advantage of chasing dividends over just buying a stock with higher growth potential  thats not shareholder benefits its shareholder right theyre not giving you something that you dont already own

of course this is unless the company offers an extra dividend for some shareholders like loréal does for instance  thats good because they arent showing much upside at the moment  this is all very sage advice and that is one helluva story

the land has been in my family for a long time which is definitely a blessing taxes as it stands are very low if that changes then we rerack the numbers we definitely have a long term outlook on the house we just bought and it will be our home first and foremost not just an idealistic equity vehicle if the plan pans out in that timeframe that would be awesome if not well well be very happy in this house  what a made up story this is  60k from rrsp then there is my fhsa and tfsa 60k would definitely not be enough i also bought with my partner  youre correct its pointless as long as you continue living in it in my country it is possible to use that 50k for renovations for example when you sell it you just dont get that 50k because its basically a loan from the bank not sure about the us though i see it around me all the time people bragging about their home value gone up but have no intention to move anytime soon  yes  you can defiantly do that to an extent  it would be a heloc  usually it works like this you would go to the bank and be like hey i want x amount of dollars to buy y the bank would send out an appraiser to somewhat make sure the house is worth what you are saying it is and be like ok sign here  you are basically selling the equity back to the bank usually at a much better interest rate than going market 

mine was going to give me a 325 loan  maybe it was only going to be that low because i was using it to do home improvements  

just looked deeper into it yes my bank will let you buy investments with a heloc  nice to know i could have locked in a 325 loan then waited and bought a 20 year treasury at 4625 and had the interest on the heloc off set some of the taxes owed on the treasury payments making that spread even better  if i hadnt started building my stock portfolio in 2016 i would not have had the money i had to buy the house like yeah if i just had a shit load more cash on hand it would have been ideal to not have to sell the stock i dont know what point youre trying to make  your 10 example is dumb because its saying essentially that stocks will have 0 real growth during inflation and will only keep pace if you will

the 20 example is much more relevant yes theyll pay capital gains tax on some of the money that actually just kept pace with inflation theyre still up relative to everyone that doesnt have tons of assets ie the workers that have to spend more for the same goods but havent had wages keep up and are watching down payments get further and further out of reach 

but lets look at your 20 example since january of 2020 inflation has been 22 sp500 has almost doubled in the same timeframe and real estate has gone up more than inflation too so again if you own assets inflation doesnt really affect you if you live paycheck to paycheck its an absolute killer  if i did i wouldnt use that for investing during an economic downturn  got it basically youre saying while others are going out you are staying in and putting more in from the small cash on sidelines as well as additional money like your job  yes thats why rich people rent and poor people buy right oh wait  theres more than enough reasons to buy a house security being one of them

for me its freedom if i want to tear down a wall i tear it down change the garden a new kitchen i can do it when i want and how i want and if something breaks i can fix it or replace it or leave it broken but i dont have to go begging to a landlord 

so yeah whilenot always the most optimal financial decision it does not have to be  porque no los dos

different strokes for different folks  but not all stocks give dividends so it is a benefit as is a special dividend

as a stockholder how do you not benefit from receiving a dividend  its probably real but its not common

i was in real estate for the last 30 years  i did see some shady stuff happen along the lines of tricking and pressing people into selling so a realtor could gain all the land she needed for a new subdivision

but the vast majority of realtor issues are more incompetence based

now most of the shady stuff is outside fraud where people claim they own property they dont and try to list it  its not dumb at all  he just used 10 stock increase and 10 inflation to clearly demonstrate how the inflationary increase in the stock price is taxed though the value didnt actually increase  every assets price is inflated by inflation and that portion of the assets price increase will be taxed  but you dont have one at the moment right what if there was an emergency and stocks were down by a lot would you be willing to sell  sell at a loss  yup exactly i probably shouldve been as concise as you  if you look at warren buffett hes still in the house he bought in the 1950s you need a place to live the best investors dont prefer real estate for compounding 

point is dont overspend on a house its not the best investment a book called stocks for the long run proved this by analyzing different asset classes over 50 years  im not saying dont buy real estate if its for investment purposes then great if its for your personal use then most of the time its 100 a liability and you have to make sure it doesnt make you house poor specially nowadays with high prices and high interest rates its tougher for most people to buy a primary residence that doesnt make them house poor  dividend doesnt change the valuation of the stock its irrelevant theyre just giving you what you already own

lol at the people downvoting you have zero idea about how to value a company  i acknowledge your points and i have to admit im probably biased by personal experience another friend for instance simply separately told the realtors where she owned a house in a large canadian city and another in a small canadian town she knew what the going rate was for the houses she owned and she wasnt accepting less she was also a respected professional on the verge of retirement she managed to get more than she asked in each sale but she didnt own those houses as investments and that is a point id emphasize she owned those houses as places to live one of which she rented to friends at a slight loss and the shady stuff how many people in toronto with a 416 number have received a cold call from a person claiming to be a realtor asking if their house was for sale anyway at the end of the day your experience probably provides a better basis on which to make a judgement or pronouncement and my own experience is more or less just that personal and anecdotal and causes me to circle back to the point i emphasized  i probably would and that bet has paid off for the last decade but also im fortunate to have dualincome lines of credit and very low expenses  true   youll need to define best invrstment its not supposed to provide the highest returns its locking in housing costs being a store of value and diversification home ownership is more valuable than simply minmaxing returns its why rich people tend to buy and not just rent  man those gurus on youtube really got you talking all the key words did you buy their courses too


buying a house to live in is one of the smartest things you could do if you could afford it why would buying a house as an investment be better than buying a house for personal use its even more of a liability lol  we bought an older home and kept the home warranty going which has paid for itself every year mostly plumbing issues 
as we own the house vs renting we have put a lot of money into it which renting you wouldnt do  painted the brick the driveway was bad so we poured new concrete as well as widening it
as owning we have homeowners insurance and taxes as well as a large water bill due to our beautiful lawn
i have a list of things that need to be fixed or upkeep
so yes you do get house poor
 in an apartment i upgrade it when i move in and put it back to normal when i leave 
it is nice in an apartment when something goes wrong you arent sweating in fear of the bill  never said anything about the stock valuation 

the dividend doesnt come out of the value of the stock  although it does affect it for a period  dividends are great its cash on their balance sheet that they dont see a need for might as well be in my pocket a cash pile on a balance sheet doesnt actually help much they already decided they cant use it for more growth  and you sounding like a real estate agent telling everyone they should buy a house and its the smartest thing you can do people are very poorly educated on the actual costs of owning a home which is just not piti and get a big surprise when something breaks 

if you buy a cash flowing property how is it even more of a liability its literally making you money while your primary home is money coming out of your pocket on a monthly basis even if the property breaks even its still less of a liability  dividend doesnt come out of the value of the stock

where does it come from then please explain",-0.7564,1.0,-1
